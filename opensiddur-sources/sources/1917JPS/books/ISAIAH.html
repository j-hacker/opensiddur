         with twain he did fly. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And one called unto another, and said:

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>Then said I: ‘Lord, how long?’ And He answered:

         shelter in the shadow of Egypt!  <span class="verse-number">3</span>Therefore shall the stronghold of Pharaoh turn to your shame,  And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your confusion.

         carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses,  And their treasures upon the humps of camels,  To a people that shall
         not profit them.  <span class="verse-number">7</span>For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose;  Therefore have I called her arrogancy that sitteth still.  <span class="verse-number">8</span>Now go, write it before them on a tablet,  And inscribe it in a book,  That it may be for the time to come  For ever and ever.
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>For it is a rebellious people,  Lying children,  Children that refuse to hear the teaching of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>;  <span class="verse-number">10</span>That say to the seers: ‘See not’,  And to the prophets: ‘Prophesy not unto us right things,  Speak unto us smooth things,

         And stay thereon;  <span class="verse-number">13</span>Therefore this iniquity shall be to you  As a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall,  Whose breaking cometh suddenly
         at an instant.  <span class="verse-number">14</span>And He shall break it as a potter’s vessel is broken,  Breaking it in pieces without sparing;  So that there shall not be
         found among the pieces thereof a sherd  To take fire from the hearth,  Or to take water out of the cistern.  <span class="verse-number">15</span>For thus said the Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span>, the Holy One of Israel:  In sitting still and rest shall ye be saved,  In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength;
         And ye would not.  <span class="verse-number">16</span>But ye said: ‘No, for we will flee upon horses’;  Therefore shall ye flee;  And: ‘We will ride upon the swift’;  Therefore
         shall they that pursue you be swift.  <span class="verse-number">17</span>One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one,  At the rebuke of five shall ye flee;  Till ye be left as a beacon upon the
         top of a mountain,  And as an ensign on a hill.  <span class="verse-number">18</span>And therefore will the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> wait, that He may be gracious unto you,  
         
         
         
         
         And therefore will He be exalted, that He may have compassion upon you;  For the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is a God of justice,  Happy are all they that wait for Him.  <span class="verse-number">19</span>For, O people that dwellest in Zion at Jerusalem,  Thou shalt weep no more;  He will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice
         of thy cry,  When He shall hear, He will answer thee.  <span class="verse-number">20</span>And though the Lord give you sparing bread and scant water,  Yet shall not thy Teacher hide Himself any more,  But thine eyes
         shall see thy Teacher;  <span class="verse-number">21</span>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying:  ‘This is the way, walk ye in it,  When ye turn to the right hand, and
         when ye turn to the left.’  <span class="verse-number">22</span>And ye shall defile thy graven images overlaid with silver,  And thy molten images covered with gold;  Thou shalt put them
         far away as one unclean;  Thou shalt say unto it: ‘Get thee hence.’  <span class="verse-number">23</span>And He will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou sowest the ground,  And bread of the increase of the ground, and it
         shall be fat and plenteous;  
         In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.  <span class="verse-number">24</span>The oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground  Shall eat savoury provender,  Wwhich hath been winnowed with the

         slaughter, when the towers fall.  <span class="verse-number">26</span>Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,  And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light
         of the seven days,  In the day that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> bindeth up the bruise of His people,  And healeth the stroke of their wound.  <span class="verse-number">27</span>Behold, the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> cometh from far,  With His anger burning, and in thick uplifting of smoke;  His lips are full of indignation,  And His tongue
         is as a devouring fire;  <span class="verse-number">28</span>And His breath is as an overflowing stream,  That divideth even unto the neck,  To sift the nations with the sieve of destruction;
         And a bridle that causeth to err shall be in the jaws of the peoples.  <span class="verse-number">29</span>Ye shall have a song  
         
         
         
         
         As in the night when a feast is hallowed;  And gladness of heart, as when one goeth with the pipe  To come into the mountain
         of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to the Rock of Israel.  <span class="verse-number">30</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will cause His glorious voice to be heard,  And will show the lighting down of His arm,  With furious anger, and the flame
         of a devouring fire,  With a bursting of clouds, and a storm of rain, and hailstones.  <span class="verse-number">31</span>For through the voice of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> shall Asshur be dismayed,  The rod with which He smote.  <span class="verse-number">32</span>And in every place where the appointed staff shall pass,  Which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> shall lay upon him,  It shall be with tabrets and harps;  And in battles of wielding will He fight with them.  <span class="verse-number">33</span>For a hearth is ordered of old;  Yea, for the king it is prepared,  Deep and large;  The pile thereof is fire and much wood;
         The breath of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.

         <h3>
            									Chapter 36
         </h3>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the 
         fortified cities of Judah, and took them. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the king of Assyria sent Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the
         conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers’field. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son
         of Asaph the recorder. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Rab-shakeh said unto them: ‘Say ye now to Hezekiah: Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is
         this wherein thou trustest? <span class="verse-number">5</span>I said: It is but vain words; for counsel and strength are for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled
         against me? <span class="verse-number">6</span>Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand,
         and pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him. <span class="verse-number">7</span>But if thou say unto me: We trust in the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God; is not that He, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem:
         Ye shall worship before this altar? <span class="verse-number">8</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, make a wager with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if
         thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. <span class="verse-number">9</span>How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain, even of the least of my master’s servants? yet thou puttest thy trust
         on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen! <span class="verse-number">10</span>And am I now come up 
         
         
         
         
         without the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> against this land to destroy it? The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto me: Go up against this land, and destroy it.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rab-shakeh: ‘Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Aramean language, for
         we understand it; and speak not to us in the Jews’language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>But Rab-shakeh said: ‘Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the
         men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then Rab-shakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’language, and said: ‘Hear ye the words of the great king, the
         king of Assyria. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah beguile you, for he will not be able to deliver you; <span class="verse-number">15</span>neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every
         one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; <span class="verse-number">17</span>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. <span class="verse-number">18</span>Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying: The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of 
         the king of Assyria? <span class="verse-number">19</span>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
         <span class="verse-number">20</span>Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">21</span>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying: ‘Answer him not.’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder,
         to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 37
         </h3>And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
         the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth,
         unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And they said unto him: ‘Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children
         are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. <span class="verse-number">4</span>It may be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God will hear the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living God, and will
         rebuke the words which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God hath heard; 
         
         
         
         
         wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Isaiah said unto them: ‘Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to
         fall by the sword in his own land.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: ‘He is come out to fight against thee.’ And when he heard it, he sent
         messengers to Hezekiah, saying: <span class="verse-number">10</span>‘Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God in whom thou trustest beguile thee, saying: Jerusalem
         shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children
         of Eden that were in Telassar? <span class="verse-number">13</span>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the
         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and spread it before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Hezekiah prayed unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: <span class="verse-number">16</span>‘O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the

         have destroyed them. <span class="verse-number">20</span>Now therefore, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, even Thou only.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>

         </h3>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, <span class="verse-number">3</span>and said: ‘Remember now, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight.’
         And Hezekiah wept sore. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then came the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> to Isaiah, saying: <span class="verse-number">5</span>‘Go, and say to Hezekiah: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

         nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah: ‘Hear the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: <span class="verse-number">6</span>Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall
