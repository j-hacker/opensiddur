         <small-caps>The</small-caps>
         <small-caps>Es</small-caps>
         <small-caps>Se</small-caps>
         <small-caps> are</small-caps> the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel beyond the Jordan; in the wilderness, in the Arabah, over against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. <verse-number>2</verse-number>It is eleven days journey from Horeb unto Kadesh-barnea by the way of mount Seir. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> had given him in commandment unto them; <verse-number>4</verse-number>after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei; <verse-number>5</verse-number>beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, took Moses upon him to expound this law, saying: <verse-number>6</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: ‘Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain; <verse-number>7</verse-number>turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the Lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore; the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. <verse-number>8</verse-number>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> swore unto your fathers, to 
         Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.’ <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>And I spoke unto you at that time, saying: ‘I am not able to bear you myself alone; <verse-number>10</verse-number>the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.—<verse-number>11</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as He hath promised you!—<verse-number>12</verse-number>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? <verse-number>13</verse-number>Get you, from each one of your tribes, wise men, and understanding, and full of knowledge, and I will make them heads over you.’ <verse-number>14</verse-number>And ye answered me, and said: ‘The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.’ <verse-number>15</verse-number>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and full of knowledge, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, tribe by tribe. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And I charged your judges at that time, saying: ‘Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. <verse-number>17</verse-number>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not 
         
         
            
         
         be afraid of the face of any man; for the judgment is God’s; and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.’ <verse-number>18</verse-number>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and dreadful wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. <verse-number>20</verse-number>And I said unto you: ‘Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God giveth unto us. <verse-number>21</verse-number>Behold, the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath set the land before thee; go up, take possession, as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.’ <verse-number>22</verse-number>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said: ‘Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us back word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.’ <verse-number>23</verse-number>And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe; <verse-number>24</verse-number>and they turned and went up into the mountains, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. <verse-number>25</verse-number>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us back word, and said: ‘Good is the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God giveth unto us.’ <verse-number>26</verse-number>Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God; <verse-number>27</verse-number>and ye murmured in your tents, 
         and said: ‘Because the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hated us, He hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. <verse-number>28</verse-number>Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying: The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.’ <verse-number>29</verse-number>Then I said unto you: ‘Dread not, neither be afraid of them. <verse-number>30</verse-number>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God who goeth before you, He shall fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes; <verse-number>31</verse-number>and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place. <verse-number>32</verse-number>Yet in this thing ye do not believe the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, <verse-number>33</verse-number>Who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.’ <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying: <verse-number>35</verse-number>‘Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers, <verse-number>36</verse-number>save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children; because he hath wholly followed the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.’ <verse-number>37</verse-number>Also the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in thither; <verse-number>38</verse-number>Joshua the son 
         
         
            
         
         of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither; encourage thou him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. <verse-number>39</verse-number>Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. <verse-number>40</verse-number>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.’ <verse-number>41</verse-number>Then ye answered and said unto me: ‘We have sinned against the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, we will go up and fight, according to all that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God commanded us.’ And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and deemed it a light thing to go up into the hill-country. <verse-number>42</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: ‘Say unto them: Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.’ <verse-number>43</verse-number>So I spoke unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country. <verse-number>44</verse-number>And the Amorites, that dwell in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah. <verse-number>45</verse-number>And ye returned and wept before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; but the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you. <verse-number>46</verse-number>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.  Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the 
         way to the Red Sea, as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto me, saying: <verse-number>3</verse-number>‘Ye have compassed this mountain long enough; turn you northward. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And command thou the people, saying: Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you; take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore; <verse-number>5</verse-number>contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession. <verse-number>6</verse-number>Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. <verse-number>7</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness; these forty years the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.’ <verse-number>8</verse-number>So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah, from Elath and from Ezion-geber.  <paragraph-break/>And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: ‘Be not at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.—<verse-number>10</verse-number>The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a 
         
         
            
         
         people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; <verse-number>11</verse-number>these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And in Seir dwelt the Horites aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> gave unto them.—<verse-number>13</verse-number>Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered.’ And we went over the brook Zered. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation, even the men of war, were consumed from the midst of the camp, as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> swore unto them. <verse-number>15</verse-number>Moreover the hand of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was against them, to discomfit them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, <verse-number>17</verse-number>that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto me saying: <verse-number>18</verse-number>‘Thou art this day to pass over the border of Moab, even Ar; <verse-number>19</verse-number>and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, harass them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.—<verse-number>20</verse-number>That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, <verse-number>21</verse-number>a people 
         great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead; <verse-number>22</verse-number>as He did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day; <verse-number>23</verse-number>and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.—<verse-number>24</verse-number>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of Arnon; behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. <verse-number>25</verse-number>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who, when they hear the report of thee, shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.’ <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying: <verse-number>27</verse-number>‘Let me pass through thy land; I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. <verse-number>28</verse-number>Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on my feet; <verse-number>29</verse-number>as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God giveth us.’ 
         
         
            
         
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: ‘Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee; begin to possess his land.’ <verse-number>32</verse-number>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz. <verse-number>33</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. <verse-number>34</verse-number>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every city, the men, and the women, and the little ones; we left none remaining; <verse-number>35</verse-number>only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken. <verse-number>36</verse-number>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us: the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God delivered up all before us. <verse-number>37</verse-number>Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wheresoever the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God forbade us.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>3</chapter-number>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: ‘Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all 
         his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.’ <verse-number>3</verse-number>So the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <verse-number>5</verse-number>All these were fortified cities, with high walls, gates, and bars; beside the unwalled towns a great many. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, the men, and the women, and the little ones. <verse-number>7</verse-number>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon unto mount Hermon—<verse-number>9</verse-number>which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir—<verse-number>10</verse-number>all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.—<verse-number>11</verse-number>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a 
         
         
            
         
         man.—<verse-number>12</verse-number>And this land we took in possession at that time; from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites; <verse-number>13</verse-number>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob—all that Bashan is called the land of Rephaim. <verse-number>14</verse-number>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.—<verse-number>15</verse-number>And I gave Gilead unto Machir. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley for a border; even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; <verse-number>17</verse-number>the Arabah also, the Jordan being the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>And I commanded you at that time, saying: ‘The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valour. <verse-number>19</verse-number>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle—I know that ye have much cattle—shall abide in your cities which I have given you; <verse-number>20</verse-number>until the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> 
         your God giveth them beyond the Jordan; then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. <verse-number>21</verse-number>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying: ‘Thine eyes have seen all that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God hath done unto these two kings; so shall the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over. <verse-number>22</verse-number>Ye shall not fear them; for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, He it is that fighteth for you.’  <parashah-title>ואתחנן</parashah-title>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>And I besought the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> at that time, saying: <verse-number>24</verse-number>‘O Lord <small-caps>God</small-caps>, Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness, and Thy strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth, that can do according to Thy works, and according to Thy mighty acts? <verse-number>25</verse-number>Let me go over, I pray Thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly hill-country, and Lebanon.’ <verse-number>26</verse-number>But the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: ‘Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto Me of this matter. <verse-number>27</verse-number>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. <verse-number>28</verse-number>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.’ <verse-number>29</verse-number>So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.  
         
         
            
         
         <chapter-number>4</chapter-number>And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, the God of your fathers, giveth you. <verse-number>2</verse-number>Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God which I command you. <verse-number>3</verse-number>Your eyes have seen what the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> did in Baal-peor; for all the men that followed the Baal of Peor, the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath destroyed them from the midst of thee. <verse-number>4</verse-number>But ye that did cleave unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God are alive every one of you this day. <verse-number>5</verse-number>Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it. <verse-number>6</verse-number>Observe therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, that, when they hear all these statutes, shall say: ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ <verse-number>7</verse-number>For what great nation is there, that hath God so nigh unto them, as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> our God is whensoever we call upon Him? <verse-number>8</verse-number>And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? <verse-number>9</verse-number>Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of 
         thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children’s children; <verse-number>10</verse-number>the day that thou stoodest before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God in Horeb, when the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: ‘Assemble Me the people, and I will make them hear My words that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.’ <verse-number>11</verse-number>And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire; ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only a voice. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even the ten words; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. <verse-number>15</verse-number>Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves—for ye saw no manner of form on the day that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire—<verse-number>16</verse-number>lest ye deal corruptly, and make you a graven image, even the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, <verse-number>17</verse-number>the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven, <verse-number>18</verse-number>the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;

         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Thou shalt not take the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God in vain; for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.  <paragraph-break/>

         thou hast heard say: ‘Who can stand before the sons of Anak?’ <verse-number>3</verse-number>Know therefore this day, that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God is He who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; He will destroy them, and He will bring them down before thee; so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath spoken unto thee. <verse-number>4</verse-number>Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying: ‘For my righteousness the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath brought me in to possess this land’; whereas for the wickedness of these nations the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> doth drive them out from before thee. <verse-number>5</verse-number>Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that He may establish the word which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. <verse-number>6</verse-number>Know therefore that it is not for thy righteousness that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God giveth thee this good land to possess it; for thou art a stiffnecked people. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>Remember, forget thou not, how thou didst make the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God wroth in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst go forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>8</verse-number>Also in Horeb ye made the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> wroth, and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was angered with you to have destroyed you. <verse-number>9</verse-number>When I was gone up into the mount to 
         
         
            
         
         receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: ‘Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have dealt corruptly; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.’ <verse-number>13</verse-number>Furthermore the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto me, saying: ‘I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people; <verse-number>14</verse-number>let Me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.’ <verse-number>15</verse-number>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God; ye had made you a molten calf; ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> had commanded you. <verse-number>17</verse-number>And I took hold of 
         the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. <verse-number>18</verse-number>And I fell down before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, to provoke Him. <verse-number>19</verse-number>For I was in dread of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was wroth against you to destroy you. But the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hearkened unto me that time also. <verse-number>20</verse-number>Moreover the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him; and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. <verse-number>21</verse-number>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and beat it in pieces, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.—<verse-number>22</verse-number>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye made the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> wroth. <verse-number>23</verse-number>And when the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: ‘Go up and possess the land which I have given you’; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, and ye believed Him not, nor hearkened to His voice. <verse-number>24</verse-number>Ye have been rebellious against the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> from the day that I knew you.—<verse-number>25</verse-number>So I fell down before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; because the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> had said He would destroy you. <verse-number>26</verse-number>And I prayed unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and said: ‘O Lord <small-caps>God</small-caps>, destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance, 
         
         
            
         
         that Thou hast redeemed through Thy greatness, that Thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. <verse-number>27</verse-number>Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin; <verse-number>28</verse-number>lest the land whence Thou broughtest us out say: Because the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was not able to bring them into the land which He promised unto them, and because He hated them, He hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. <verse-number>29</verse-number>Yet they are Thy people and Thine inheritance, that Thou didst bring out by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm.’  <chapter-number>10</chapter-number>At that time the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: ‘Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto Me into the mount; and make thee an ark of wood. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them in the ark.’ <verse-number>3</verse-number>So I made an ark of acacia-wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And He wrote on the tables according to the first writing, the ten words, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly; and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> gave them unto me. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded me.—<verse-number>6</verse-number>And the children 
         of Israel journeyed from Beeroth-benejaakan to Moserah; there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead. <verse-number>7</verse-number>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod; and from Gudgod to Jotbah, a land of brooks of water.—<verse-number>8</verse-number>At that time the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, to stand before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day. <verse-number>9</verse-number>Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is his inheritance, according as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God spoke unto him.—<verse-number>10</verse-number>Now I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hearkened unto me that time also; the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> would not destroy thee. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto me: ‘Arise, go before the people, causing them to set forward, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>And now, Israel, what doth the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God require of thee, but to fear the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul; <verse-number>13</verse-number>to keep for thy good the commandments of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and His statutes, which I command thee this day? <verse-number>14</verse-number>Behold, unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God belongeth the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that therein is. <verse-number>15</verse-number>Only the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> had a delight in thy fathers to 
         
         
            
         
         love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you, above all peoples, as it is this day. <verse-number>16</verse-number>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. <verse-number>17</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awful, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward. <verse-number>18</verse-number>He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. <verse-number>19</verse-number>Love ye therefore the stranger; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thou shalt fear the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God; Him shalt thou serve; and to Him shalt thou cleave, and by His name shalt thou swear. <verse-number>21</verse-number>He is thy glory, and He is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and tremendous things, which thine eyes have seen. <verse-number>22</verse-number>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.  <chapter-number>11</chapter-number>Therefore thou shalt love the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God, and keep His charge, and His statutes, and His ordinances, and His commandments, alway. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And know ye this day; for I speak not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm, <verse-number>3</verse-number>and His signs, and His works, which He did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; <verse-number>4</verse-number>and what He did unto the army of Egypt, 
         unto their horses, and to their chariots; how He made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath destroyed them unto this day; <verse-number>5</verse-number>and what He did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place; <verse-number>6</verse-number>and what He did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living substance that followed them, in the midst of all Israel; <verse-number>7</verse-number>but your eyes have seen all the great work of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> which He did. <verse-number>8</verse-number>Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it; <verse-number>9</verse-number>and that ye may prolong your days upon the land, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou didst sow thy seed, and didst water it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs; <verse-number>11</verse-number>but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down; <verse-number>12</verse-number>a land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God careth for; the eyes of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

         <verse-number>13</verse-number>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments which I command you this day, to love the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, <verse-number>14</verse-number>that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. <verse-number>16</verse-number>Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; <verse-number>17</verse-number>and the anger of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> be kindled against you, and He shut up the heaven, so that there shall be no rain, and the ground shall not yield her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> giveth you. <verse-number>18</verse-number>Therefore shall ye lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. <verse-number>19</verse-number>And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. <verse-number>20</verse-number>And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates; <verse-number>21</verse-number>that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.

         <verse-number>26</verse-number>Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse: <verse-number>27</verse-number>the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, which I command you this day; <verse-number>28</verse-number>and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. <verse-number>4</verse-number>These are the beasts which ye may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, <verse-number>5</verse-number>the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the mountain-sheep. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And every beast that parteth the hoof, and hath the hoof wholly cloven in two, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that ye may eat.

         <verse-number>21</verse-number>Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself; thou mayest give it unto the stranger that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner; for thou art a holy people unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God. Thou

         <verse-number>12</verse-number>If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years; and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty; <verse-number>14</verse-number>thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; of that wherewith the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God redeemed thee; therefore I command thee this thing to-day. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And it shall be, if he say unto thee: ‘I will not go out from thee’; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he fareth well with thee; <verse-number>17</verse-number>then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his

And also unto thy bondwoman thou shalt do likewise. <verse-number>18</verse-number>It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years; and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God; thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thine ox, nor shear the firstling of thy flock. <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thou shalt eat it before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God year by year in the place which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shall choose, thou and thy household. <verse-number>21</verse-number>And if there be any blemish therein, lameness, or blindness, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God. <verse-number>22</verse-number>Thou shalt eat it within thy gates; the unclean and the clean may eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart. <verse-number>23</verse-number>Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water.  <chapter-number>16</chapter-number>Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God; for in the month of Abib the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shall choose to cause His name to dwell there. <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread 
         
         
            
         
         therewith, even the bread of affliction; for in haste didst thou come forth out of the land of Egypt; that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all they borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. <verse-number>5</verse-number>Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover-offering within any of thy gates, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God giveth thee; <verse-number>6</verse-number>but at the place which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God shall choose to cause His name to dwell in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God shall choose; and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. <verse-number>8</verse-number>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God; thou shalt do no work therein. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee; from the time the sickle is first put to the standing corn shalt thou begin to number seven weeks. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God after the measure of the freewill-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give, according as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God blesseth thee. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And thou shalt rejoice before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy

         unto My words which he shall speak in My name, I will require it of him. <verse-number>20</verse-number>But the prophet, that shall speak a word presumptuously in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.’ <verse-number>21</verse-number>And if thou say in thy heart: ‘How shall we know the word which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath not spoken?’ <verse-number>22</verse-number>When a prophet speaketh in the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath not spoken; the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.  <chapter-number>19</chapter-number>When the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God shall cut off the nations, whose land the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God giveth thee, and thou dost succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses; <verse-number>2</verse-number>thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy <small-caps>God</small-caps> giveth thee to possess it. <verse-number>3</verse-number>Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in time past; <verse-number>5</verse-number>as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of these cities and 
         
         
            
         
         live; <verse-number>6</verse-number>lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not deserving of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. <verse-number>7</verse-number>Wherefore I command thee, saying: ‘Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.’ <verse-number>8</verse-number>And if the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God enlarge thy border, as He hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which He promised to give unto thy fathers—<verse-number>9</verse-number>if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God, and to walk ever in His ways—then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three; <verse-number>10</verse-number>that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die; and he flee into one of these cities; <verse-number>12</verse-number>then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. <verse-number>13</verse-number>Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the blood of the innocent from Israel, that it may go well with thee.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land 
         that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God giveth thee to possess it.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be establishment<verse-number>16</verse-number>If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to bear perverted witness against him; <verse-number>17</verse-number>then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days. <verse-number>18</verse-number>And the judges shall inquire diligently; and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; <verse-number>19</verse-number>then shall ye do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. <verse-number>20</verse-number>And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee. <verse-number>21</verse-number>And thine eye shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>20</chapter-number>When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, <verse-number>3</verse-number>and shall say unto them: ‘Hear, O Israel, ye draw 
         
         
            
         
         nigh this day unto battle against your enemies; let not your heart faint; fear not, nor be alarmed, neither be ye affrighted at them; <verse-number>4</verse-number>for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God is He that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.’ <verse-number>5</verse-number>And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying: ‘What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit thereof. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.’ <verse-number>8</verse-number>And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say: ‘What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart melt as his heart.’ <verse-number>9</verse-number>And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that captains of hosts shall be appointed at the head of the people.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall 
         serve thee. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And when the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword; <verse-number>14</verse-number>but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath given thee. <verse-number>15</verse-number>Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations. <verse-number>16</verse-number>Howbeit of the cities of these peoples, that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth, <verse-number>17</verse-number>but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath commanded thee; <verse-number>18</verse-number>that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods, and so ye sin against the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, but thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of thee? <verse-number>20</verse-number>Only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, them thou mayest destroy and cut down, that thou mayest 
         
         
            
         
         build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall.  <chapter-number>21</chapter-number>If one be found slain in the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him; <verse-number>2</verse-number>then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which may neither be plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near—for them the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God hath chosen to minister unto Him, and to bless in the name of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And they shall speak and say: ‘Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. <verse-number>8</verse-number>Forgive, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, Thy people Israel, whom Thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of Thy people Israel.’ And the blood shall be forgiven them. <verse-number>9</verse-number>So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the 
         midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <parashah-title>כי תצא</parashah-title>

         <verse-number>10</verse-number>When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive, <verse-number>11</verse-number>and seest among the captives a woman of goodly form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; <verse-number>12</verse-number>then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; <verse-number>13</verse-number>and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month; and after that thou mayest go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated; <verse-number>16</verse-number>then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born; <verse-number>17</verse-number>but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for 
         
         
            
         
         he is the first-fruits of his strength, the right of the first-born is his.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not hearken to the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them; <verse-number>19</verse-number>then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; <verse-number>20</verse-number>and they shall say unto the elders of his city: ‘This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he doth not hearken to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.’ <verse-number>21</verse-number>And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree; <verse-number>23</verse-number>his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a reproach unto God; that thou defile not thy land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.  <chapter-number>22</chapter-number>Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep driven away, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely bring them back unto thy brother. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, and thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother require it, and thou shalt restore it to him. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And so 
         shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found; thou mayest not hide thyself. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young; <verse-number>7</verse-number>thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed; lest the fulness of the seed which thou hast sown be forfeited together with the increase of the vineyard.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. <verse-number>11</verse-number>Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together.  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Thou shalt make thee twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, <verse-number>14</verse-number>and lay wanton charges against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say: ‘I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity’; <verse-number>15</verse-number>then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders: ‘I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; <verse-number>17</verse-number>and, lo, he hath laid wanton charges, saying: I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity.’ And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city. <verse-number>18</verse-number>And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him. <verse-number>19</verse-number>And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel; <verse-number>21</verse-number>then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die; because she hath wrought a wanton 
         deed in Israel, to play the harlot in her father’s house; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a man, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; <verse-number>24</verse-number>then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die: the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife; so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man take hold of her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die. <verse-number>26</verse-number>But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death; for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter. <verse-number>27</verse-number>For he found her in the field; the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; <verse-number>29</verse-number>then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be 
         
         
            
         
         his wife, because he hath humbled her; he may not put her away all his days. <chapter-number>23</chapter-number>A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>2</verse-number>He that is crushed or maimed in his privy parts shall not enter into the assembly of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>4</verse-number>An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; even to the tenth generation shall none of them enter into the assembly of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> for ever; <verse-number>5</verse-number>because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Aram-naharaim, to curse thee. <verse-number>6</verse-number>Nevertheless the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God loved thee. <verse-number>7</verse-number>Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land. <verse-number>9</verse-number>The children of the third generation that are born unto them may enter into the assembly of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt 
         keep thee from every evil thing. <verse-number>11</verse-number>If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp. <verse-number>12</verse-number>But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he may come within the camp. <verse-number>13</verse-number>Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee. <verse-number>15</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy; that He see no unseemly thing in thee, and turn away from thee.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a bondman that is escaped from his master unto thee; <verse-number>17</verse-number>he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of thy gates, where it liketh him best; thou shalt not wrong him.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>There shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel. <verse-number>19</verse-number>Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God for any vow; for even both these are an abomination unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God.

         <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother: interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of any thing that is lent upon interest. <verse-number>21</verse-number>Unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest; that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>When thou shalt vow a vow unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it; for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God will surely require it of thee; and it will be sin in thee. <verse-number>23</verse-number>But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. <verse-number>24</verse-number>That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; according as thou hast vowed freely unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God, even that which thou hast promised with thy mouth. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>2</verse-number>and she departeth out of his house, and goeth and becometh another man’s wife, <verse-number>3</verse-number>and the latter husband hateth her, and writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife; <verse-number>4</verse-number>her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free for his house one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.  <paragraph-break/>

         will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them; and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath spoken. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will do unto them as He did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom He destroyed. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you. <verse-number>6</verse-number>Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them; for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God, He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel: ‘Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt go with this people into the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, He it is that doth go before thee; He will be with thee, He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bore the ark of the covenant of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and unto all the elders of Israel. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And Moses commanded them, saying: ‘At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, <verse-number>11</verse-number>when all Israel is come to appear before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> thy God in the place which He shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their 
         hearing. <verse-number>12</verse-number>Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, and observe to do all the words of this law; <verse-number>13</verse-number>and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Moses: ‘Behold, thy days approach that thou must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge.’ And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud; and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Moses: ‘Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake Me, and break My covenant which I have made with them. <verse-number>17</verse-number>Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day: Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us? <verse-number>18</verse-number>And I will surely hide My face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they 
         
         
            
         
         are turned unto other gods. <verse-number>19</verse-number>Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel. <verse-number>20</verse-number>For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten their fill, and waxen fat; and turned unto other gods, and served them, and despised Me, and broken My covenant; <verse-number>21</verse-number>then it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed; for I know their imagination how they do even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.’ <verse-number>22</verse-number>So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. <verse-number>23</verse-number>And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said: ‘Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore unto them; and I will be with thee.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, <verse-number>25</verse-number>that Moses commanded the Levites, that bore the ark of the covenant of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, saying: <verse-number>26</verse-number>‘Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee. <verse-number>27</verse-number>For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck; 
         behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and how much more after my death? <verse-number>28</verse-number>Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. <verse-number>29</verse-number>For I know that after my death ye will in any wise deal corruptly, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the end of days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, to provoke Him through the work of your hands.’ <verse-number>30</verse-number>And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished:  <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>18</verse-number>Of the Rock that begot thee thou wast unmindful,  <paragraph-break/>And didst forget God that bore thee.  <paragraph-break/> 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> saw, and spurned,  <paragraph-break/>Because of the provoking of His sons and  <paragraph-break/>His daughters.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>And He said: ‘I will hide My face from them,  <paragraph-break/>I will see what their end shall be;  <paragraph-break/>For they are a very froward generation, <paragraph-break/>Children in whom is no faithfulness. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>They have roused Me to jealousy with a no-god;  <paragraph-break/>They have provoked Me with their vanities;  <paragraph-break/>And I will rouse them to jealousy with a no-people;  <paragraph-break/>I will provoke them with a vile nation. <verse-number>22</verse-number>For a fire is kindled in My nostril,  <paragraph-break/>And burneth unto the depths of the nether-world,  <paragraph-break/>And devoureth the earth with her produce, <paragraph-break/>And setteth ablaze the foundations of the mountains.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>I will heap evils upon them;  <paragraph-break/>I will spend Mine arrows upon them;  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>The wasting of hunger, and the  <paragraph-break/> devouring of the fiery bolt,  <paragraph-break/>And bitter destruction;  <paragraph-break/>And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them,  <paragraph-break/>With the venom of crawling things of the dust.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>Without shall the sword bereave,  <paragraph-break/>And in the chambers terror;  <paragraph-break/>Slaying both young man and virgin,  
         <paragraph-break/>The suckling with the man of gray hairs.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>I thought I would make an end of them,  <paragraph-break/>I would make their memory cease from among men;  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>Were it not that I dreaded the enemy’s provocation,  <paragraph-break/>Lest their adversaries should misdeem,  <paragraph-break/>Lest they should say: Our hand is exalted,  <paragraph-break/>And not the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath wrought all this.’  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>For they are a nation void of counsel,  <paragraph-break/>And there is no understanding in them.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>If they were wise, they would understand this,  <paragraph-break/>They would discern their latter end.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>How should one chase a thousand,  <paragraph-break/>And two put ten thousand to flight,  <paragraph-break/>Except their Rock had given them over  <paragraph-break/>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> had delivered them up? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>For their rock is not as our Rock,  <paragraph-break/>Even our enemies themselves being  <paragraph-break/> judges.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, <paragraph-break/>And of the fields of Gomorrah;  <paragraph-break/>Their grapes are grapes of gall,  <paragraph-break/>Their clusters are bitter;  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>Their wine is the venom of serpents,  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>And the cruel poison of asps.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>‘Is not this laid up in store with Me,  <paragraph-break/>Sealed up in My treasuries? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>Vengeance is Mine, and recompense,  <paragraph-break/>Against the time when their foot shall slip;  <paragraph-break/>For the day of their calamity is at hand,  <paragraph-break/>And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>36</verse-number>For the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will judge His people,  <paragraph-break/>And repent Himself for His servants;  <paragraph-break/>When He seeth that their stay is gone,  <paragraph-break/>And there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>37</verse-number>And it is said: Where are their gods,  <paragraph-break/>The rock in whom they trusted;  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>38</verse-number>Who did eat the fat of their sacrifices,  <paragraph-break/>And drank the wine of their drink- <paragraph-break/> offering?  <paragraph-break/>Let him rise up and help you,  <paragraph-break/>Let him be your protection.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>39</verse-number>See now that I, even I, am He,  <paragraph-break/>And there is no god with Me;  <paragraph-break/>I kill, and I make alive;  <paragraph-break/>I have wounded, and I heal;  <paragraph-break/>And there is none that can deliver out of My hand.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>40</verse-number>For I lift up My hand to heaven,  
         <paragraph-break/>And say: As I live for ever,  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>41</verse-number>If I whet My glittering sword,  <paragraph-break/>And My hand take hold on judgment;  <paragraph-break/>I will render vengeance to Mine  <paragraph-break/> adversaries,  <paragraph-break/>And will recompense them that hate Me.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>42</verse-number>I will make Mine arrows drunk with blood,  <paragraph-break/>And My sword shall devour flesh;  <paragraph-break/>With the blood of the slain and the captives,  <paragraph-break/>From the long-haired heads of the enemy.’  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>43</verse-number>Sing aloud, O ye nations, of His people;  <paragraph-break/>For He doth avenge the blood of His servants,  <paragraph-break/>And doth render vengeance to His  <paragraph-break/> adversaries,  <paragraph-break/>And doth make expiation for the land of His people.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>44</verse-number>And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. <verse-number>45</verse-number>And when Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel, <verse-number>46</verse-number>he said unto them: ‘Set your heart unto all the words wherewith I testify against you this day; that ye may charge your children therewith to observe to do all the words of this law. <verse-number>47</verse-number>For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days upon 
         
         
            
         
         the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>48</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses that selfsame day, saying: <verse-number>49</verse-number>‘Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession; <verse-number>50</verse-number>and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people. <verse-number>51</verse-number>Because ye trespassed against Me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribath-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel. <verse-number>52</verse-number>For thou shalt see the land afar off; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.’  <parashah-title>וזאת הברכה</parashah-title>
         <chapter-number>33</chapter-number>And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And he said:  <paragraph-break/>The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> came from Sinai,  <paragraph-break/>And rose from Seir unto them;  <paragraph-break/>He shined forth from mount Paran,  <paragraph-break/>And He came from the myriads holy,  <paragraph-break/>At His right hand was a fiery law unto  them.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>Yea, He loveth the peoples,  <paragraph-break/>All His holy ones—they are in Thy hand;  <paragraph-break/>And they sit down at Thy feet,  
         <paragraph-break/>Receiving of Thy words.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>Moses commanded us a law,  <paragraph-break/>An inheritance of the congregation of  <paragraph-break/>Jacob.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>And there was a king in Jeshurun,  <paragraph-break/>When the heads of the people were gathered,  <paragraph-break/>All the tribes of Israel together.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>Let Reuben live, and not die  <paragraph-break/>In that his men become few.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>And this for Judah, and he said:  <paragraph-break/>Hear, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, the voice of Judah,  <paragraph-break/>And bring him in unto his people;  <paragraph-break/>His hands shall contend for him,  <paragraph-break/>And Thou shalt be a help against his  <paragraph-break/> adversaries.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>And of Levi he said:  <paragraph-break/>Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one,  <paragraph-break/>Whom Thou didst prove at Massah,  <paragraph-break/>With whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>Who said of his father, and of his mother: ‘I have not seen him’;  <paragraph-break/>Neither did he acknowledge his brethren,  <paragraph-break/>Nor knew he his own children;  <paragraph-break/>For they have observed Thy word,  <paragraph-break/>And keep Thy covenant.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>They shall teach Jacob Thine ordinances,  <paragraph-break/>And Israel Thy law;  <paragraph-break/>They shall put incense before Thee,  <paragraph-break/>And whole burnt-offering upon Thine altar.  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>Bless, <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, his substance,  <paragraph-break/>And accept the work of his hands;  <paragraph-break/>Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him,  <paragraph-break/>And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>Of Benjamin he said:  <paragraph-break/>The beloved of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shall dwell in safety by Him;  <paragraph-break/>He covereth him all the day,  <paragraph-break/>And He dwelleth between his shoulders.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>And of Joseph he said:  <paragraph-break/>Blessed of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> be his land;  <paragraph-break/>For the precious things of heaven, for the dew,  <paragraph-break/>And for the deep that coucheth beneath,  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,  <paragraph-break/>And for the precious things of the yield of the moons,  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>15</verse-number>And for the tops of the ancient  <paragraph-break/> mountains,  <paragraph-break/>And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof,  <paragraph-break/>And the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush;  <paragraph-break/>Let the blessing come upon the head of  <paragraph-break/>Joseph,  <paragraph-break/>And upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren.  
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>His firstling bullock, majesty is his;  <paragraph-break/>And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox;  <paragraph-break/>With them he shall gore the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth;  <paragraph-break/>And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,  <paragraph-break/>And they are the thousands of Manasseh. <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>18</verse-number>And of Zebulun he said:  <paragraph-break/>Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out,  <paragraph-break/>And, Issachar, in thy tents.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>They shall call peoples unto the mountain;  <paragraph-break/>There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness;  <paragraph-break/>For they shall suck the abundance of the seas,  <paragraph-break/>And the hidden treasures of the sand.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>And of Gad he said:  <paragraph-break/>Blessed be He that enlargeth Gad;  <paragraph-break/>He dwelleth as a lioness,  <paragraph-break/>And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>And he chose a first part for himself,  <paragraph-break/>For there a portion of a ruler was reserved;  <paragraph-break/>And there came the heads of the people,  <paragraph-break/>He executed the righteousness of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>And His ordinances with Israel.  <paragraph-break/> 
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>And of Dan he said:  <paragraph-break/>Dan is a lion’s whelp,  <paragraph-break/>That leapeth forth from Bashan.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>23</verse-number>And of Naphtali he said:  <paragraph-break/>O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,  <paragraph-break/>And full with the blessing of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>:  <paragraph-break/>Possess thou the sea and the south.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>And of Asher he said:  <paragraph-break/>Blessed be Asher above sons;  <paragraph-break/>Let him be the favoured of his brethren,  <paragraph-break/>And let him dip his foot in oil.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>Iron and brass shall be thy bars;  <paragraph-break/>And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun,  <paragraph-break/>Who rideth upon the heaven as thy help,  <paragraph-break/>And in His excellency on the skies.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>The eternal God is a dwelling-place,  <paragraph-break/>And underneath are the everlasting arms;  <paragraph-break/>And He thrust out the enemy from before thee,  <paragraph-break/>And said: ‘Destroy.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>And Israel dwelleth in safety,  <paragraph-break/>The fountain of Jacob alone,  <paragraph-break/>In a land of corn and wine;  <paragraph-break/>Yea, his heavens drop down dew.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee?  <paragraph-break/>A people saved by the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>,  <paragraph-break/>The shield of thy help,  
         <paragraph-break/>And that is the sword of thy excellency!  <paragraph-break/>And thine enemies shall dwindle away before thee;  <paragraph-break/>And thou shalt tread upon their high places.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>34</chapter-number>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> showed him all the land, even Gilead as far as Dan; <verse-number>2</verse-number>and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the hinder sea; <verse-number>3</verse-number>and the South, and the Plain, even the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, as far as Zoar. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto him: ‘This is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying: I will give it unto thy seed; I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.’ <verse-number>5</verse-number>So Moses the servant of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And he was buried in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor; and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon 
         
         
            
         
         him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> knew face to face; <verse-number>11</verse-number>in all the signs and the 
         wonders, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land; <verse-number>12</verse-number>and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
