         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Trust ye not in lying words, saying: ‘The temple of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the temple of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the temple of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, are these.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>Nay, but if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbour;
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after

         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">12</span>For go ye now unto My place which was in Shiloh, where I caused My name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for
         the wickedness of My people Israel. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and I spoke unto you, speaking betimes and often, but ye heard not, and I called you, but ye answered not; <span class="verse-number">14</span>therefore will I do unto the house, whereupon My name

         ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.’ <span class="verse-number">24</span>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in their own counsels, even in the stubbornness of their evil heart,
         and went backward and not forward, <span class="verse-number">25</span>even since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day; and though I have sent unto you all

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">29</span>Cut off thy hair, and cast it away,

         built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the
         fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into My mind. <span class="verse-number">32</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter; for they shall
         bury in Topheth, for lack of room. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall

         Hearken to My voice, and do them, according to all which I command you; so shall ye be My people, and I will be your God;
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>that I may establish the oath which I swore unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this

         betimes and often, saying: Hearken to My voice. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Yet they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart; therefore I

         hearken unto them. <span class="verse-number">12</span>Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer; but they shall
         not save them at all in the time of their trouble. <span class="verse-number">13</span>For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have
         ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to offer unto Baal. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear

         not hearkened; <span class="verse-number">6</span>then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.’  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying:

         month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke unto me in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying: <span class="verse-number">2</span>‘Thus speaketh the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Within two full years will I bring back into this place all the vessels of the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon; <span class="verse-number">4</span>and I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went
         to Babylon, saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people
         that stood in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, <span class="verse-number">6</span>even the prophet Jeremiah said: ‘Amen! the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> do so! the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to 
         bring back the vessels of the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> house, and all them that are carried away captive, from Babylon unto this place! <span class="verse-number">7</span>Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: <span class="verse-number">8</span>The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms,
         of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. <span class="verse-number">9</span>The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath truly sent him.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">10</span>Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.’
         And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. <span class="verse-number">12</span>Then the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying:
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>‘Go, and tell Hananiah, saying: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou shalt make in their stead bars of iron. <span class="verse-number">14</span>For thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar
         king of Babylon; and they shall serve him; and I have given him the beasts of the field also.’ 
         
         
         
         
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet: ‘Hear now, Hananiah; the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. <span class="verse-number">16</span>‘Therefore thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth; this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken perversion
         against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

         </h3>Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the
         captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">4</span>Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem unto Babylon:

         them before your eyes; <span class="verse-number">22</span>and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah that are in Babylon, saying: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire’; <span class="verse-number">23</span>because they have wrought vile deeds in Israel, and have committed

         and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying: <span class="verse-number">26</span>‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there should be officers in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in the collar. <span class="verse-number">27</span>Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you, <span class="verse-number">28</span>forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying: The captivity is long; build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant
         gardens, and eat the fruit of them?’ <span class="verse-number">29</span>And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. <span class="verse-number">30</span>Then came the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> unto Jeremiah, saying: <span class="verse-number">31</span>Send to all them of the captivity, saying: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused

            									Chapter 32
         </h3>The word that came to Jeremiah from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of
         the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house. <span class="verse-number">3</span>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying: ‘Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; <span class="verse-number">4</span>and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand
         of the king of 
         Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; <span class="verse-number">5</span>and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I remember him, saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Jeremiah said: ‘The word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came unto me, saying: <span class="verse-number">7</span>Behold, Hanamel, the son of Shallum thine uncle, shall come unto thee, saying: Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for
         the right of redemption is thine to buy it.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>So Hanamel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said unto me: ‘Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance
         is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels
         of silver. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. <span class="verse-number">11</span>So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine
         uncle[‘s son], and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, 
         
         
         
         
         before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And I charged Baruch before them, saying: <span class="verse-number">14</span>‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this deed which
         is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days. <span class="verse-number">15</span>For thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: <span class="verse-number">17</span>‘Ah Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span>! behold, Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard

         the great, the mighty God, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts is His name; <span class="verse-number">19</span>great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according
         to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings; <span class="verse-number">20</span>who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel and among other men; and madest Thee
         a name, as at this day; <span class="verse-number">21</span>and didst bring forth Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and
         with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; <span class="verse-number">22</span>and gavest them this land, which 
         Thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; <span class="verse-number">23</span>and they came in, and possessed it; but they hearkened not to Thy voice, neither walked in Thy law; they have done nothing
         of all that Thou commandedst them to do; therefore Thou hast caused all this evil to befall them; <span class="verse-number">24</span>behold the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight
         against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what Thou hast spoken is come to pass; and,
         behold, Thou seest it. <span class="verse-number">25</span>Yet Thou hast said unto me, O Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span>: Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>Then came the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> unto Jeremiah, saying: <span class="verse-number">27</span>‘Behold, I am the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of all flesh; is there any thing too hard for Me? <span class="verse-number">28</span>Therefore thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he
         shall take it; <span class="verse-number">29</span>and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon
         whose roofs they have offered unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke Me. <span class="verse-number">30</span>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done that which was evil in My sight from their youth; for

         provoked Me with the work of their hands, saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">31</span>For this city hath been to Me a provocation of Mine anger and of My fury from the day that they built it even unto this day,
         that I should remove it from before My face; <span class="verse-number">32</span>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me, they,
         their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And they have turned unto Me the back, and not the face; and though I taught them, teaching them betimes and often, yet they
         have not hearkened to receive instruction. <span class="verse-number">34</span>But they set their abominations in the house whereupon My name is called, to defile it. <span class="verse-number">35</span>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to set apart their sons and their daughters
         unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into My mind, that they should do this abomination; to cause Judah
         to sin. <span class="verse-number">36</span>And now therefore thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say: It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword,
         and by the famine, and by the pestilence: <span class="verse-number">37</span>Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in Mine anger, and in My fury, and in great
         wrath; and I will bring them back unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely; <span class="verse-number">38</span>and they shall be My people, and I will be their God; <span class="verse-number">39</span>and I 
         will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me for ever; for the good of them, and of their children after them;
         <span class="verse-number">40</span>and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put My
         fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me. <span class="verse-number">41</span>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in truth with My whole heart and with My
         whole soul. <span class="verse-number">42</span>For thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised
         them. <span class="verse-number">43</span>And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say: It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of
         the Chaldeans. <span class="verse-number">44</span>Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in
         the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the Lowland,
         and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’

         Hananiah, and all the princes. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying: ‘Take
         in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come.’ So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll
         in his hand, and came unto them. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And they said unto him: ‘Sit down now, and read it in our ears.’ 
         So Baruch read it in their ears. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch: ‘We
         will surely tell the king of all these words.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And they asked Baruch, saying: ‘Tell us now: How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then Baruch answered them: ‘He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.’
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>Then said the princes unto Baruch: ‘Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah, and let no man know where ye are.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And they went in to the king into the court; but they had deposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they
         told all the words in the ears of the king. <span class="verse-number">21</span>So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in
         the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month; and the brazier was burning before him. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, that he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire
         that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. <span class="verse-number">25</span>Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had entreated the king not to burn the roll; but he 
         
         
         
         
         would not hear them. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch
         the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hid them.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">27</span>Then the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying:
         <span class="verse-number">28</span>‘Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king
         of Judah hath burned. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say: Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Thou hast burned this roll, saying: Why hast thou written therein, saying: The king of Babylon shall certainly come and
         destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? <span class="verse-number">30</span>Therefore thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out
         in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. <span class="verse-number">31</span>And I will visit upon him and his seed and his servants their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants
         of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">32</span>Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of

         </h3>And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
         made king in the land of Judah. <span class="verse-number">2</span>But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah,
         saying: ‘Pray now unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God for us.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they
         broke up from Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then came the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying: <span class="verse-number">7</span>‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto Me to inquire of Me: Behold, Pharaoh’s army,
         which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the Chaldeans shall return, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Deceive not yourselves, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they 
         
         
         
         
         shall not depart. <span class="verse-number">10</span>For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among
         them, yet would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, <span class="verse-number">12</span>then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the
         people. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the
         son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying: ‘Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>Then said Jeremiah: ‘It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans’; but he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah,
         and brought him to the princes. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they
         had made that the prison.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; <span class="verse-number">17</span>then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him; and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said: ‘Is there any word from
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>?’ And Jeremiah said: ‘There is.’ He said also: ‘Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>Moreover 
         Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah: ‘Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that
         ye have put me in prison? <span class="verse-number">19</span>Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying: The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against

         me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and they gave him daily a loaf
         of bread out of the bakers’street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.

         Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke unto all the people, saying: <span class="verse-number">2</span>‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to

         of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them; for this man seeketh not
         the welfare of this people, but the hurt.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then Zedekiah the king said: ‘Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the pit of Malchiah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard; and they
         let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the pit there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.

         pit; and he is like to die in the place where he is because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying: ‘Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the
         prophet out of the pit, before he die.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence worn clouts
         and worn rags, and let them down by cords into the pit to Jeremiah. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah: ‘Put now these worn 
         clouts and rags under thine armholes under the cords.’ And Jeremiah did so. <span class="verse-number">13</span>So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the pit; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.

         <span class="verse-number">14</span>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that was in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the king said unto Jeremiah: ‘I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah: ‘If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel,
         thou wilt not hearken unto me.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>So Zedekiah the king swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying: ‘As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek
         thy life.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live,

         and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah: ‘I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver
         me into their hand, and they mock me.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>But 
         
         
         
         
         Jeremiah said: ‘They shall not deliver thee. Hearken, I beseech thee, to the voice of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, in that which I speak unto thee; so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live. <span class="verse-number">21</span>But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath shown me: <span class="verse-number">22</span>Behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes,
         and those women shall say:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Thy familiar friends have set thee on,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And have prevailed over thee;

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And they are turned away back.  <span class="verse-number">23</span>And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but
         shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah: ‘Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die. <span class="verse-number">25</span>But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee: Declare unto us now what
         thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee; <span class="verse-number">26</span>then thou shalt say unto them: I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s
         house, to die there.’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words 
         that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not reported. <span class="verse-number">28</span>So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.

         <span class="verse-number">13</span>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,

         take thy life?’ But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. <span class="verse-number">15</span>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying: ‘Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael
         the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it; wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto
         thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah: ‘Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely

         of 
         
         
         
         
         the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat
         bread together in Mizpah. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son
         of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there,
         even the men of war.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, <span class="verse-number">5</span>that there came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and
         their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand to bring them to the house
         of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went; and it came to pass, as
         he met them, he said unto them: ‘Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into
         the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. <span class="verse-number">8</span>But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael: ‘Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat,
         and of barley, and of 
         oil, and of honey.’ So he forbore, and slew them not among their brethren. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah was that which Asa
         the king had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel; the same Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled with them that were slain.
         <span class="verse-number">10</span>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the
         people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael
         the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.

         Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying: <span class="verse-number">2</span>‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah;
         and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein; <span class="verse-number">3</span>because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me, in that they went to offer, and to serve other gods,
         whom they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Howbeit I sent unto you all My servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often, saying: Oh, do not this abominable thing
         that I hate. <span class="verse-number">5</span>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to forbear offering unto other gods. <span class="verse-number">6</span>Wherefore My fury and Mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem;
         and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Therefore now thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man
         and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining; <span class="verse-number">8</span>in that ye provoke Me with the works of your hands, offering unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to
         sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? <span class="verse-number">9</span>Have ye forgotten the wicked deeds of your fathers, and the wicked deeds 
         
         
         
         
         of the kings of Judah, and the wicked deeds of their wives, and your own wicked deeds, and the wicked deeds of your wives,
         which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? <span class="verse-number">10</span>They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in My law, nor in My statutes, that I set before
         you and before your fathers. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Therefore thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set My face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall
         all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die,
         from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment,
         and a curse, and a reproach. <span class="verse-number">13</span>For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by
         the pestilence; <span class="verse-number">14</span>so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that
         they should return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for none shall return save
         such as shall escape.’

         in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil. <span class="verse-number">18</span>But since we let off to offer to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things,
         and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And is it we that offer to the queen of heaven, and pour out drink-offerings unto her? did we make her cakes in her image,

         is your land 
         
         
         
         
         become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. <span class="verse-number">23</span>Because ye have offered, and because ye have sinned against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and have not hearkened to the voice of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, nor walked in His law, nor in His statutes, nor in His testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this

         unto her; ye shall surely establish your vows, and surely perform your vows. <span class="verse-number">26</span>Therefore hear ye the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by My great name, saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt saying: As the Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span> liveth. <span class="verse-number">27</span>Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed
         by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the

         <span class="verse-number">29</span>And this shall be the sign unto you, saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that My words shall surely stand against you for evil; <span class="verse-number">30</span>thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life;

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">59</span>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the
         king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was quartermaster. <span class="verse-number">60</span>And Jeremiah wrote in one book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning
         Babylon. <span class="verse-number">61</span>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: ‘When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words, <span class="verse-number">62</span>and say: O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it
         shall be desolate for ever. <span class="verse-number">63</span>And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the
         midst of the Euphrates; <span class="verse-number">64</span>and thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring upon her; and
         they shall be weary.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div> 
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div> Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to 
         reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. <span class="verse-number">3</span>For through the anger of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until He had cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the
         king of Babylon. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar
         king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round
         about. <span class="verse-number">5</span>So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. <span class="verse-number">6</span>In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people
         of the land. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the
         gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden—now the Chaldeans were against the city round about—and they went
         by the way of the Arabah. <span class="verse-number">8</span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was
         scattered from him. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment
         upon him. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the king of 
         
         
         
         
         Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him
         in prison till the day of his death.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,
         came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem; <span class="verse-number">13</span>and he burned the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great man’s house, burned he with fire. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest sort of the people, and the residue of the people
         that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude. <span class="verse-number">16</span>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. <span class="verse-number">18</span>The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and all the 
         vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And the cups, and the fire-pans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the pans, and the bowls—that which
         was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver—the captain of the guard took away. <span class="verse-number">20</span>The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house
         of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>—the brass of all these vessels was without weight. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and
         the thickness thereof was four fingers; it was hollow. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon
         the capital round about, all of brass; and the second pillar also had like unto these, and pomegranates. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And there were ninety and six pomegranates on the outside; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
         door; <span class="verse-number">25</span>and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and seven men of them that saw the king’s face, who
         were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men
         of the people of the land, that were 
         
         
         
         
         found in the midst of the city. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive
         out of his land. <span class="verse-number">28</span>This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty;
         <span class="verse-number">29</span>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar, from Jerusalem, eight hundred thirty and two persons; <span class="verse-number">30</span>in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven
         hundred forty and five persons; all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. 
         <span class="verse-number">31</span>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in
         the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the
         head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And he changed his prison garments, and did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day
         of his death, all the days of his life.
