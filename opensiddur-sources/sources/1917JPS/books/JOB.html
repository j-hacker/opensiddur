         <span class="small-caps">There</span> was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was whole-hearted and upright, and one that feared God, and
         shunned evil. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. <span class="verse-number">3</span>His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred
         she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they would send and invite their three
         sisters to eat and to drink with them. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the
         morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said: ‘It may be that my sons have sinned,
         and blasphemed God in their hearts.’ Thus did Job continually.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>Now it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and

         </div>Satan came also among them. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Satan: ‘Whence comest thou?’ Then Satan answered the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, 
         and said: ‘From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Satan: ‘Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright
         man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then Satan answered the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: ‘Doth Job fear God for nought? <span class="verse-number">10</span>Hast not Thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? Thou hast blessed the
         work of his hands, and his possessions are increased in the land. <span class="verse-number">11</span>But put forth Thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Satan: ‘Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand.’ So Satan went forth
         from the presence of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, <span class="verse-number">14</span>that there came a messenger unto Job, and said: ‘The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them; <span class="verse-number">15</span>and the Sabeans made a raid, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
         am escaped alone to tell thee.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: ‘A 
         
         
         
         
         fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped
         alone to tell thee.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: ‘The Chaldeans set themselves in three bands, and fell upon
         the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone
         to tell thee.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: ‘Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in
         their eldest brother’s house; <span class="verse-number">19</span>And, behold, there came a great wind from across the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon
         the young people, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">20</span>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped; <span class="verse-number">21</span>And he said;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Naked came I out of my mother’s womb,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And naked shall I return thither;  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath taken away;  Blessed be the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  <span class="verse-number">22</span>For all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed aught unseemly to God.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 2
         </h3>Again it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Satan: ‘From whence 
         comest thou?’ And Satan answered the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: ‘From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Satan: ‘Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright
         man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou didst move Me against
         him, to destroy him without cause.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Satan answered the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: ‘Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. <span class="verse-number">5</span>But put forth Thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Satan: ‘Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>So Satan went forth from the presence of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot even unto his crown. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then said his wife unto him: ‘Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? blaspheme God, and die.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>But he said unto her: ‘Thou speakest as one of the impious women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God,
         and shall we not receive evil?’ For all this did not Job sin with his lips.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz
         the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the 
         
         
         
         
         Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one
         his mantle, and threw dust upon their heads toward heaven. <span class="verse-number">13</span>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him; for they saw that his
         grief was very great.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div> 
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 3
         </h3>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Job spoke, and said:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>Let the day perish wherein I was born,
