         <chapter-number>1</chapter-number>And <small-caps>the</small-caps> 
         <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying: <verse-number>2</verse-number>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:  <paragraph-break/>When any man of you bringeth an offering unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd or of the flock. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>3</verse-number>If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And he shall kill the bullock before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and dash the blood round about against the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the suet, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar; <verse-number>9</verse-number>but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar, for a burnt-
         offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall dash its blood against the altar round about. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And he shall cut it into its pieces; and the priest shall lay them, with its head and its suet, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar. <verse-number>13</verse-number>But the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>And if his offering to the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and pinch off its head, and make it smoke on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And he shall take away its crop with the feathers thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes. <verse-number>17</verse-number>And he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall make it 
         
         
            
         
         smoke upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <chapter-number>2</chapter-number>And when any one bringeth a meal-offering unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, together with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>3</verse-number>But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>And when thou bringest a meal-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>5</verse-number>And if thy offering be a meal-offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. <verse-number>6</verse-number>Thou shalt break it in pieces, and pour oil thereon; it is a meal-offering. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>And if thy offering be a meal-offering of the stewing-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And the priest shall take off 
         from the meal-offering the memorial-part thereof, and shall make it smoke upon the altar—an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>10</verse-number>But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire. <verse-number>11</verse-number>No meal-offering, which ye shall bring unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>12</verse-number>As an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; but they shall not come up for a sweet savour on the altar. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And every meal-offering of thine shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering; with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>And if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, thou shalt bring for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits corn in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon; it is a meal-offering. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the priest shall make the memorial-part of it smoke, even of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; it is an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <chapter-number>3</chapter-number>And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offerings: if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before 
         
         
            
         
         the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons the priests shall dash the blood against the altar round about. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <verse-number>4</verse-number>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away hard by the kidneys. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And Aaron’s sons shall make it smoke on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>6</verse-number>And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> be of the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. <verse-number>7</verse-number>If he bring a lamb for his offering, then shall he present it before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons shall dash the blood thereof against the altar round about. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And he shall present of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>: the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, which he shall take away hard by the rump-bone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <verse-number>10</verse-number>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the 
         kidneys. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>And if his offering be a goat, then he shall present it before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall dash the blood thereof against the altar round about. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And he shall present thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <verse-number>15</verse-number>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savour; all the fat is the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps>. <verse-number>17</verse-number>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>4</chapter-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>2</verse-number>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:  <paragraph-break/>If any one shall sin through error, in any of the things which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them: <verse-number>3</verse-number>if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> for a sin-offering. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And he shall bring 
         
         
            
         
         the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in front of the veil of the sanctuary. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the remaining blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, <verse-number>9</verse-number>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by kidneys, <verse-number>10</verse-number>as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar of burnt-offering. <verse-number>11</verse-number>But the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung, <verse-number>12</verse-number>even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.  
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>And if the whole congregation of Israel shall err, the thing being hid from the eyes of the assembly, and do any of the things which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty: <verse-number>14</verse-number>when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and the bullock shall be killed before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting. <verse-number>17</verse-number>And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in front of the veil. <verse-number>18</verse-number>And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, that is in the tent of meeting, and all the remaining blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting. <verse-number>19</verse-number>And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and make it smoke upon the altar. <verse-number>20</verse-number>Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven. <verse-number>21</verse-number>And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock; it is the sin-offering for the assembly. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>When a ruler sinneth, and doeth through error any one of all the things 
         
         
            
         
         which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty: <verse-number>23</verse-number>if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish. <verse-number>24</verse-number>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; it is a sin-offering. <verse-number>25</verse-number>And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering. <verse-number>26</verse-number>And all the fat thereof shall he make smoke upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>And if any one of the common people sin through error, in doing any of the things which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty: <verse-number>28</verse-number>if his sin, which he hath sinned, be known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. <verse-number>29</verse-number>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering. <verse-number>30</verse-number>And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and all the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. <verse-number>31</verse-number>And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as 
         the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>32</verse-number>And if he bring a lamb as his offering for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. <verse-number>33</verse-number>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering. <verse-number>34</verse-number>And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and all the remaining blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar. <verse-number>35</verse-number>And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make them smoke on the altar, upon the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.  <chapter-number>5</chapter-number>And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity; <verse-number>2</verse-number>or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean swarming things, and be guilty, it being hidden from him that he is unclean; <verse-number>3</verse-number>or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his 
         
         
            
         
         uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; and, when he knoweth of it, be guilty; <verse-number>4</verse-number>or if any one swear clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and it be hid from him; and, when he knoweth of it, be guilty in one of these things; <verse-number>5</verse-number>and it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned; <verse-number>6</verse-number>and he shall bring his forfeit unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his forfeit for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>: one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and pinch off its head close by its neck, but shall not divide it asunder. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin-offering. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And he shall prepare the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>But if his means suffice not for two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, 
         then he shall bring his offering for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial-part thereof, and make it smoke on the altar, upon the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire; it is a sin-offering. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven; and the remnant shall be the priest’s, as the meal-offering.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>15</verse-number>If any one commit a trespass, and sin through error, in the holy things of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, then he shall bring his forfeit unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt-offering. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall be forgiven.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>And if any one sin, and do any of the things which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded not to be done, though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. <verse-number>18</verse-number>And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, 
         
         
            
         
         according to thy valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the error which he committed, though he knew it not, and he shall be forgiven. <verse-number>19</verse-number>It is a guilt-offering—he is certainly guilty before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>21</verse-number>If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and deal falsely with his neighbour in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbour; <verse-number>22</verse-number>or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein; <verse-number>23</verse-number>then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, <verse-number>24</verse-number>or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely, he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto; unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being guilty. <verse-number>25</verse-number>And he shall bring his forfeit unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest. <verse-number>26</verse-number>And the priest shall make atonement for him before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and he shall be forgiven, concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby.  <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>6</chapter-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>2</verse-number> Command Aaron and his sons, saying:  <paragraph-break/>This is the law of the burnt-offering: it is that which goeth up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereby. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby, it shall not go out; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall make smoke thereon the fat of the peace-offerings. <verse-number>6</verse-number>Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>7</verse-number>And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in front of the altar. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat; it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in 
         
         
            
         
         the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it. <verse-number>10</verse-number>It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the guilt-offering. <verse-number>11</verse-number>Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as a due for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>13</verse-number>This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening. <verse-number>14</verse-number>On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in; in broken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savour unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it, it is a due for ever; it shall be wholly made to smoke unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>18</verse-number>Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying:  <paragraph-break/>This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; it is most holy. <verse-number>19</verse-number>The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the 
         court of the tent of meeting. <verse-number>20</verse-number>Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place. <verse-number>21</verse-number>But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken; and if it be sodden in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. <verse-number>22</verse-number>Every male among the priests may eat thereof; it is most holy. <verse-number>23</verse-number>And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire.  <chapter-number>7</chapter-number>And this is the law of the guilt-offering: it is most holy. <verse-number>2</verse-number>In the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the guilt-offering: and the blood thereof shall be dashed against the altar round about. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, <verse-number>4</verse-number>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe above the liver, which he shall take away by the kidneys. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; it is a guilt-offering. <verse-number>6</verse-number>Every male among the priests may eat thereof; it shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. <verse-number>7</verse-number>As is the sin-offering, so is the guilt-offering; there is one law for them; the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall 
         
         
            
         
         have it. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the stewing-pan, and on the griddle, shall be the priest’s that offereth it. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>11</verse-number>And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one may offer unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>12</verse-number>If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked. <verse-number>13</verse-number>With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And of it he shall present one out of each offering for a gift unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; it shall be the priest’s that dasheth the blood of the peace-offerings against the altar. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. <verse-number>16</verse-number>But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it may be eaten. <verse-number>17</verse-number>But that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice 
         on the third day shall be burnt with fire. <verse-number>18</verse-number>And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it; it shall be an abhorred thing, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. <verse-number>19</verse-number>And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire.

         <verse-number>22</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>23</verse-number>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:  <paragraph-break/>Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. <verse-number>24</verse-number>And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it. <verse-number>25</verse-number>For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. <verse-number>26</verse-number>And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your

         <verse-number>28</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>29</verse-number>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:  <paragraph-break/>He that offereth his sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shall bring his offering unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> out of his sacrifice of peace-offerings. <verse-number>30</verse-number>His own hands shall bring the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire: the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>31</verse-number>And the priest shall make the fat smoke upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. <verse-number>32</verse-number>And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of your sacrifices of peace-offerings. <verse-number>33</verse-number>He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion. <verse-number>34</verse-number>For the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving have I taken of the children of Israel out of their sacrifices of peace-offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>This is the consecrated portion of Aaron, and the consecrated portion of his sons, out of the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire, in the day when they were presented to minister unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in the priest’s office; <verse-number>36</verse-number>which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that

         <verse-number>37</verse-number>This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the guilt-offering, and of the consecration-offering, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; <verse-number>38</verse-number>which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, in the wilderness of Sinai.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>8</chapter-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>2</verse-number>‘Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; <verse-number>3</verse-number>and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.’ <verse-number>4</verse-number>And Moses did as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And Moses said unto the congregation: ‘This is the thing which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded to be done.’ <verse-number>6</verse-number>And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And he put upon him the tunic, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And he placed the breastplate upon him; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And he set the mitre 
         
         
            
         
         upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And the bullock of the sin-offering was brought; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And when it was slain, Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the remaining blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses made it smoke upon the altar. <verse-number>17</verse-number>But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, were burnt with fire without the camp; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses. <verse-number>18</verse-number>And the ram of the burnt-offering was presented; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. <verse-number>19</verse-number>And when it was killed, 
         Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about. <verse-number>20</verse-number>And when the ram was cut into its pieces, Moses made the head, and the pieces, and the suet smoke. <verse-number>21</verse-number>And when the inwards and the legs were washed with water, Moses made the whole ram smoke upon the altar; it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses. <verse-number>22</verse-number>And the other ram was presented, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. <verse-number>23</verse-number>And when it was slain, Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. <verse-number>24</verse-number>And Aaron’s sons were brought, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot; and Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about. <verse-number>25</verse-number>And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh. <verse-number>26</verse-number>And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh. <verse-number>27</verse-number>And he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>28</verse-number>And Moses took them from off 
         
         
            
         
         their hands, and made them smoke on the altar upon the burnt-offering; they were a consecration-offering for a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>29</verse-number>And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; it was Moses’portion of the ram of consecration; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses. <verse-number>30</verse-number>And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’garments with him. <verse-number>31</verse-number>And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons: ‘Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting; and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat it. <verse-number>32</verse-number>And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. <verse-number>33</verse-number>And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled; for He shall consecrate you seven days. <verse-number>34</verse-number>As hath been done this day, so the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you. <verse-number>35</verse-number>And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, that ye die not; for so I am commanded. <verse-number>36</verse-number>And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded by the hand of Moses.

         <chapter-number>9</chapter-number>And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; <verse-number>2</verse-number>and he said unto Aaron: ‘Take thee a bull-calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering; <verse-number>4</verse-number>and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and a meal-offering mingled with oil; for to-day the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> appeareth unto you.’ <verse-number>5</verse-number>And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the congregation drew near and stood before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And Moses said: ‘This is the thing which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded that ye should do; that the glory of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> may appear unto you.’ <verse-number>7</verse-number>And Moses said unto Aaron: ‘Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and present the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded.’ <verse-number>8</verse-number>So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the 
         
         
            
         
         horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar. <verse-number>10</verse-number>But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, he made smoke upon the altar; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And the flesh and the skin were burnt with fire without the camp. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head; and he made them smoke upon the altar. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And he washed the inwards and the legs, and made them smoke upon the burnt-offering on the altar. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And the people’s offering was presented; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the burnt-offering was presented; and he offered it according to the ordinance. <verse-number>17</verse-number>And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and made it smoke upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning. <verse-number>18</verse-number>He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about, <verse-number>19</verse-number>and the fat of the ox, and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver. <verse-number>20</verse-number>And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he made the fat smoke upon the altar. <verse-number>21</verse-number>And the 
         breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; as Moses commanded. <verse-number>22</verse-number>And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings. <verse-number>23</verse-number>And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and the glory of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> appeared unto all the people. <verse-number>24</verse-number>And there came forth fire from before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat; and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.  <chapter-number>10</chapter-number>And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, which He had not commanded them. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And there came forth fire from before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and devoured them, and they died before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>3</verse-number>Then Moses said unto Aaron: ‘This is it that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke, saying: Through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.’ And Aaron held his peace. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them: ‘Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.’ <verse-number>5</verse-number>So they drew near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his 
         
         
            
         
         sons: ‘Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither tend your clothes, that ye die not, and that He be not wroth with all the congregation; but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath kindled. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is upon you.’ And they did according to the word of Moses. <paragraph-break/>
         <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Aaron, saying: <verse-number>9</verse-number>‘Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And that ye may put difference between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; <verse-number>11</verse-number>and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>12</verse-number>And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: ‘Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons’due, of the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire; for so I am commanded. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for 
         they are given as thy due, and thy sons’due, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel. <verse-number>15</verse-number>The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they bring with the offerings of the fat made by fire, to wave it for a wave-offering before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’with thee, as a due for ever; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And Moses diligently inquired for the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt; and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying: <verse-number>17</verse-number>‘Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and He hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>? <verse-number>18</verse-number>Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within; ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.’ <verse-number>19</verse-number>And Aaron spoke unto Moses: ‘Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and there have befallen me such things as these; and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>? <verse-number>20</verse-number>And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>11</chapter-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them: <verse-number>2</verse-number>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:  
         
         
            
         
         <paragraph-break/>These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. <verse-number>3</verse-number>Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is wholly cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat. <verse-number>4</verse-number>Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And the rock-badger, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you<verse-number>7</verse-number>And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you. <verse-number>8</verse-number>Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them may ye eat. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that swarm in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are a detestable thing unto you, <verse-number>11</verse-number>and they shall be a detestable thing unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in detestation. <verse-number>12</verse-number>Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is a detestable thing unto you.  <paragraph-break/>

         <parashah-title>אמר</parashah-title>
         <chapter-number>21</chapter-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Moses: Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them:  <paragraph-break/>There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people; <verse-number>2</verse-number>except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother; <verse-number>3</verse-number>and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband, for her may he defile himself. <verse-number>4</verse-number>He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself. <verse-number>5</verse-number>They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. <verse-number>6</verse-number>They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer; therefore they shall be holy. <verse-number>7</verse-number>They shall not take a woman 
         that is a harlot, or profaned; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband; for he is holy unto his God. <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God; he shall be holy unto thee; for I the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, who sanctify you, am holy. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>10</verse-number>And the priest that is highest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes; <verse-number>11</verse-number>neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; <verse-number>12</verse-number>neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And he shall take a wife in her virginity. <verse-number>14</verse-number>A widow, or one divorced, or a profaned woman, or a harlot, these shall he not take; but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And he shall not profane his seed among his people; for I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> who sanctify him.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>17</verse-number>Speak unto Aaron, saying:  <paragraph-break/>Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. <verse-number>18</verse-number>For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind 
         
         
            
         
         man, or a lame, or he that hath any thing maimed, or anything too long, <verse-number>19</verse-number>or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed, <verse-number>20</verse-number>or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath his eye overspread, or is scabbed, or scurvy, or hath his stones crushed; <verse-number>21</verse-number>no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> made by fire; he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. <verse-number>22</verse-number>He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. <verse-number>23</verse-number>Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not My holy places; for I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> who sanctify them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>24</verse-number>So Moses spoke unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.  <chapter-number>22</chapter-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>2</verse-number>Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto Me, and that they profane not My holy name: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>3</verse-number>Say unto them:  <paragraph-break/>Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before Me: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>4</verse-number>What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue, he shall not eat 
         of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any one that is unclean by the dead; or from whomsoever the flow of seed goeth out; <verse-number>5</verse-number>or whosoever toucheth any swarming thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; <verse-number>6</verse-number>the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because it is his bread. <verse-number>8</verse-number>That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>9</verse-number>They shall therefore keep My charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> who sanctify them. <verse-number>10</verse-number>There shall no <note mark="a" id="note-187-a"> That is, <other-text font="Times New Roman,Italic" size="10.046" y="36.399">one who is not a priest</other-text>. </note>common man eat of the holy thing; a tenant of a priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. <verse-number>11</verse-number>But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he may eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they may eat of his bread. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And if a priest’s daughter be married unto a common man, she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the holy things. <verse-number>13</verse-number>But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread; but there shall no common man 
         
         
            
         
         eat thereof. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And if a man eat of the holy thing through error, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they set apart unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; <verse-number>16</verse-number>and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things; for I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> who sanctify them.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>17</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>18</verse-number>Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them:  <paragraph-break/>Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that bringeth his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will-offerings, which are brought unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> for a burnt-offering; <verse-number>19</verse-number>that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. <verse-number>20</verse-number>But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not bring; for it shall not be acceptable for you. <verse-number>21</verse-number>And whosoever bringeth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. <verse-number>22</verse-number>Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scabbed, or scurvy, ye shall not offer these unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>23</verse-number>Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing too long or 
         too short, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. <verse-number>24</verse-number>That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut, ye shall not offer unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; neither shall ye do thus in your land. <verse-number>25</verse-number>Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>27</verse-number>When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; but from the eighth day and thenceforth it may be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>28</verse-number>And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day. <verse-number>29</verse-number>And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted. <verse-number>30</verse-number>On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>31</verse-number>And ye shall keep My commandments, and do them: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>32</verse-number>And ye shall not profane My holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> who hallow you, <verse-number>33</verse-number>that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>23</chapter-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>2</verse-number>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:

         <verse-number>4</verse-number>These are the appointed seasons of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season. <verse-number>5</verse-number>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk, is the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps> passover. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. <verse-number>7</verse-number>In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses saying: <verse-number>10</verse-number>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:  <paragraph-break/>When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And he shall wave the sheaf before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-

         whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people. <verse-number>30</verse-number>And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people. <verse-number>31</verse-number>Ye shall do no manner of work; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. <verse-number>32</verse-number>It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>34</verse-number>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying:  <paragraph-break/>On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>35</verse-number>On the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. <verse-number>36</verse-number>Seven days ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; it is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>10</verse-number>And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses.

         <chapter-number>25</chapter-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying: <verse-number>2</verse-number>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:  <paragraph-break/>When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a 
         sabbath unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>3</verse-number>Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the produce thereof. <verse-number>4</verse-number>But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. <verse-number>5</verse-number>That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather; it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And the sabbath-produce of the land shall be for food for you: for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for the settler by thy side that sojourn with thee; <verse-number>7</verse-number>and for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>8</verse-number>And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years. <verse-number>9</verse-number>Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of the horn on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye make proclamation with the horn throughout all your land. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. <verse-number>11</verse-number>A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you; ye shall not sow, neither reap that which 
         
         
            
         
         groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of the undressed vines. <verse-number>12</verse-number>For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you; ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. <verse-number>13</verse-number>In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbour, or buy of thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not wrong one another. <verse-number>15</verse-number>According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee. <verse-number>16</verse-number>According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of crops doth he sell unto thee. <verse-number>17</verse-number>And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God; for I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God. <verse-number>18</verse-number>Wherefore ye shall do My statutes, and keep Mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. <verse-number>19</verse-number>And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat until ye have enough, and dwell therein in safety. <verse-number>20</verse-number>And if ye shall say: ‘What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase’; <verse-number>21</verse-number>then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years. <verse-number>22</verse-number>And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the produce, the old store; until the ninth year, until her produce come in, ye shall eat the old store. <verse-number>23</verse-number>And the land shall not be sold 
         in perpetuity; for the land is Mine; for ye are strangers and settlers with Me. <verse-number>24</verse-number>And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>If thy brother be waxen poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold. <verse-number>26</verse-number>And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxen rich and find sufficient means to redeem it; <verse-number>27</verse-number>then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession. <verse-number>28</verse-number>But if he have not sufficient means to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee; and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption. <verse-number>30</verse-number>And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the jubilee. <verse-number>31</verse-number>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee. <verse-number>32</verse-number>But as for the cities 
         
         
            
         
         of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption. <verse-number>33</verse-number>And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold in the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. <verse-number>34</verse-number>But the fields of the open land about their cities may not be sold; for that is their perpetual possession. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>And if thy brother be waxen poor, and his means fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: as a stranger and a settler shall he live with thee. <verse-number>36</verse-number>Take thou no interest of him or increase; but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. <verse-number>37</verse-number>Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase. <verse-number>38</verse-number>I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>39</verse-number>And if thy brother be waxen poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee, thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant. <verse-number>40</verse-number>As a hired servant, and as a settler, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee. <verse-number>41</verse-number>Then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. <verse-number>42</verse-number>For they are My servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bondmen. <verse-number>43</verse-number>Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy 
         God. <verse-number>44</verse-number>And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou mayest have: of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. <verse-number>45</verse-number>Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them may ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land; and they may be your possession. <verse-number>46</verse-number>And ye may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession: of them may ye take your bondmen for ever; but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigour. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>47</verse-number>And if a stranger who is a settler with thee be waxen rich, and thy brother be waxen poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger who is a settler with thee, or to the offshoot of a stranger’s family, <verse-number>48</verse-number>after that he is sold he may be redeemed; one of his brethren may redeem him; <verse-number>49</verse-number>or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxen rich, he may redeem himself. <verse-number>50</verse-number>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him. <verse-number>51</verse-number>If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he 
         
         
            
         
         was bought for. <verse-number>52</verse-number>And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption. <verse-number>53</verse-number>As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him; he shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. <verse-number>54</verse-number>And if he be not redeemed by any of these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him. <verse-number>55</verse-number>For unto Me the children of Israel are servants; they are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God.  <chapter-number>26</chapter-number>Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it; for I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> your God. <verse-number>2</verse-number>Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.  <parashah-title>בחקתי</parashah-title>

         <verse-number>3</verse-number>If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them; <verse-number>4</verse-number>then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread until ye have enough, and dwell in your land safely. <verse-number>6</verse-number>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the

         <verse-number>14</verse-number>But if ye will not hearken unto Me, and will not do all these commandments; <verse-number>15</verse-number>and if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all My commandments, but break My covenant; <verse-number>16</verse-number>I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall make the eyes to fail, and the soul to languish; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. <verse-number>17</verse-number>And I will set My face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies; they that hate you shall rule

         your enemies shall eat you up. <verse-number>39</verse-number>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. <verse-number>40</verse-number>And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their treachery which they committed against Me, and also that they have walked contrary unto Me. <verse-number>41</verse-number>I also will walk contrary unto them, and bring them into the land of their enemies; if then perchance their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then be paid the punishment of their iniquity; <verse-number>42</verse-number>then will I remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. <verse-number>43</verse-number>For the land shall lie forsaken without them, and shall be paid her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall be paid the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected Mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred My statutes. <verse-number>44</verse-number>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> their God. <verse-number>45</verse-number>But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>.

         <verse-number>14</verse-number>And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, then the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be his.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And if a man shall sanctify unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> part of the field of his possession, then thy valuation shall be according to the sowing thereof; the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. <verse-number>17</verse-number>If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy valuation it shall stand. <verse-number>18</verse-number>But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from thy valuation. <verse-number>19</verse-number>And if he that sanctified the field will 
         indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. <verse-number>20</verse-number>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. <verse-number>21</verse-number>But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s. <verse-number>22</verse-number>And if he sanctify unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession; <verse-number>23</verse-number>then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy valuation unto the year of jubilee; and he shall give thy valuation in that day, as a holy thing unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>24</verse-number>In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth. <verse-number>25</verse-number>And all thy valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>26</verse-number>Howbeit the firstling among beasts, which is born as a firstling to the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps>. <verse-number>27</verse-number>And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof; or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy valuation. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man may devote unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his 
         
         
            
         
         possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>29</verse-number>None devoted, that may be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>30</verse-number>And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps>; it is holy unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>31</verse-number>And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof. <verse-number>32</verse-number>And 
         all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>33</verse-number>He shall not inquire whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>34</verse-number>These are the commandments, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
