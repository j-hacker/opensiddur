         <h2>FIRST SAMUEL</h2>
         
         
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 1
         </h3>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham,
         the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah
         had no children. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there priests unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass upon a day, when Elkanah sacrificed, that he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters,
         portions; <span class="verse-number">5</span>but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had shut up her womb. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And her rival vexed her sore, to make her fret, because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had shut up her womb. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, so she vexed her; therefore she wept, and would not eat. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And Elkanah her husband said unto her: ‘Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am
         not I better to thee than ten sons?’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they 
         had drunk—now Eli the priest sat upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; <span class="verse-number">10</span>and she was in bitterness of soul—and prayed unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and wept sore. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And she vowed a vow, and said: ‘O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt
         give unto Thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And it came to pass, as she prayed long before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that Eli watched her mouth. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; therefore, Eli thought she had
         been drunken. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And Eli said unto her: ‘How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Hannah answered and said: ‘No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
         but I poured out my soul before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I spoken hitherto.’
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>Then Eli answered and said: ‘Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of Him.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And she said: ‘Let thy servant find 
         
         
         
         
         favour in thy sight.’ So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> remembered her. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel:
         ‘because I have asked him of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">21</span>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. <span class="verse-number">22</span>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband: ‘Until the child be weaned, when I will bring him, that he may appear
         before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and there abide for ever.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And Elkanah her husband said unto her: ‘Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> establish His word.’ So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and
         brought him unto the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Shiloh; and the child was young. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And when the bullock was slain, the child was brought to Eli. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And she said: ‘Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">27</span>For this child I prayed; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath granted me my petition which I asked 
         of Him; <span class="verse-number">28</span>therefore I also have lent him to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; as long as he liveth he is lent to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ And he worshipped the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> there.

         <h3>
            									Chapter 2
         </h3>And Hannah prayed, and said:  My heart exulteth in the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>,

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div> 
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> before Eli the priest.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while
         the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his band; <span class="verse-number">14</span>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the 
         flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in Shiloh. <span class="verse-number">15</span>Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: ‘Give flesh to roast
         for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And if the man said unto him: ‘Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth’; then
         he would say: ‘Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And the sin of the young men was very great before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>But Samuel ministered before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. <span class="verse-number">19</span>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
         offer the yearly sacrifice. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ And they would go unto their own home. <span class="verse-number">21</span>So the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service
         at the door of the tent of meeting. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And he said unto them: ‘Why do ye such things? for I 
         
         
         
         
         hear evil reports concerning you from all this people. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Nay, my sons; for it is no good report which I hear the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> people do spread abroad. <span class="verse-number">25</span>If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who shall entreat for him?’ But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> would slay them. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and also with men.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">27</span>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house? <span class="verse-number">28</span>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an
         ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire? <span class="verse-number">29</span>Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest thy sons above
         Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people? <span class="verse-number">30</span>Therefore the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but
         now the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> saith: Be it far from Me: for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed. <span class="verse-number">31</span>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, 
         that there shall not be an old man in thy house. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And thou shalt behold a rival in My habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old
         man in thy house for ever. <span class="verse-number">33</span>Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish; and all
         the increase of thy house shall die young men. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And this shall be the sign unto thee, that which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall
         die both of them. <span class="verse-number">35</span>And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and in My mind; and I will
         build him a sure house; and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever. <span class="verse-number">36</span>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and
         a loaf of bread, and shall say: Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.’ 
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 3
         </h3>And the child Samuel ministered unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> before Eli. And the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place—now his eyes had begun to wax dim, that he could not
         see—<span class="verse-number">3</span>and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep in the temple of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, where the ark of God was, <span class="verse-number">4</span>that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> called Samuel; and he said: ‘Here am I.’ 
         
         
         
         
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>And he ran unto Eli, and said: ‘Here am I; for thou didst call me.’ And he said: ‘I called not; lie down again.’ And he went
         and lay down. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> called yet again Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said: ‘Here am I; for thou didst call me.’ And he answered:
         ‘I called not, my son; lie down again.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>Now Samuel did not yet know the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, neither was the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> yet revealed unto him. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said: ‘Here am I; for thou didst call me.’ And Eli
         perceived that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was calling the child. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel: ‘Go, lie down; and it shall be, if thou be called, that thou shalt say: Speak, <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for Thy servant heareth.’ So Samuel went and lay down in his place. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came, and stood, and called as at other times: ‘Samuel, Samuel.’ Then Samuel said: ‘Speak; for Thy servant heareth.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel: ‘Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. <span class="verse-number">12</span>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity, in that he knew that his sons did bring a curse
         upon themselves, and he rebuked them not. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with 
         sacrifice nor offering for ever.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. And Samuel feared to tell Eli the vision. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then Eli called Samuel, and said: ‘Samuel, my son.’ And he said: ‘Here am I.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And he said: ‘What is the thing that He hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me, God do so to thee, and more
         also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that He spoke unto thee.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said: ‘It is the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; let Him do what seemeth Him good.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>And Samuel grew, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared again in Shiloh; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 4
         </h3>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer; and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and when the battle was spread, Israel was smitten before the
         Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said: ‘Wherefore hath the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> smitten us to-day before the 
         
         
         
         
         Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> out of Shiloh unto us, that He may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, who sitteth upon the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant
         of God. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And when the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said: ‘What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp
         of the Hebrews?’ And they knew that the ark of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was come into the camp. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said: ‘God is come into the camp.’ And they said: ‘Woe unto us! for there was not
         such a thing yesterday and the day before. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all
         manner of plagues and in the wilderness. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to
         you; quit yourselves like men, and fight.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent; and there was a very great slaughter;
         for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the ark of God was 
         taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon
         his head. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the
         man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said: ‘What meaneth the noise of this tumult?’ And the man made haste, and
         came and told Eli. <span class="verse-number">15</span>Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could not see. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And the man said unto Eli: ‘I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army.’ And he said: ‘How went
         the matter, my son?’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And he that brought the tidings answered and said: ‘Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great
         slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate,
         and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

         then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then said they: ‘What shall be the guilt-offering which we shall return to Him?’ And they said: ‘Five golden emerods, and
         five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the

         cart, and bring their calves home from them. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And take the ark of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return Him for a guilt-
         offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And see, if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then He hath done us this great evil; but if not, then

         for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments
         of war, and the instruments of his chariots. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.

         the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valour.

         they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not; and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they
         found them not. <span class="verse-number">5</span>When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him: ‘Come and let us return; lest my father
         leave caring for the asses, and become anxious concerning us.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And he said unto him: ‘Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honour; all that he
         saith cometh surely to pass; now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>Then said Saul to his servant: ‘But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
         and there is not a present to bring to the man of God; what have we?’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the servant answered Saul again, and said: ‘Behold, I have in my 
         
         
         
         
         hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver, that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.’—<span class="verse-number">9</span>Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said: ‘Come and let us go to the seer’; for he that is now
         called a prophet was beforetime called a seer.—<span class="verse-number">10</span>Then said Saul to his servant: ‘Well said; come, let us go.’ So they went unto the city where the man of God was. <span class="verse-number">11</span>As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them: ‘Is the seer
         here?’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And they answered them, and said: ‘He is; behold, he is before thee; make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city;
         for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place. <span class="verse-number">13</span>As soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat; for the people
         will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get
         you up; for at this time ye shall find him.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And they went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high
         place.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>Now the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying: <span class="verse-number">16</span>‘To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over
         My people Israel, and he shall save My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have 
         looked upon My people, because their cry is come unto Me.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And when Samuel saw Saul, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke unto him: ‘Behold the man of whom I said unto thee: This same shall have authority over My people.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>And Samuel answered Saul, and said: ‘I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day;
         and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the
         desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>And Saul answered and said: ‘Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all
         the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them
         that were bidden, who were about thirty persons. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And Samuel said unto the cook: ‘Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee: Set it by thee.’ <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And [Samuel] said: ‘Behold that which
         hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it 
         
         
         
         
         been kept for thee, for I said: I have invited the people.’ So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he spoke with Saul upon the housetop. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And they arose early; and it came to pass about the break of day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying: ‘Up,
         that I may send thee away.’ And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. <span class="verse-number">27</span>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: ‘Bid the servant pass on before us—and he passed on—but
         stand thou still at this time, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.’  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 10
         </h3>Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said: ‘Is it not that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath anointed thee to be prince over His inheritance? <span class="verse-number">2</span>When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by the tomb of Rachel, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah;
         and they will say unto thee: The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for
         the asses, and is anxious concerning you, saying: What shall I do for my son? <span class="verse-number">3</span>Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the terebinth of Tabor, and there shall meet thee there
         three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying
         a bottle of wine. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And 
         they will salute thee, and give thee two cakes of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hand. <span class="verse-number">5</span>After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines; and it shall come to pass, when thou
         art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and
         a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the spirit of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as thy hand shall find; for God is with thee. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice
         sacrifices of peace-offerings; seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and tell thee what thou shalt do.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to
         pass that day. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of God came mightily upon him,
         and he prophesied among them. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people
         said one to another: ‘What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also 
         
         
         
         
         among the prophets?’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And one of the same place answered and said: ‘And who is their father?’ Therefore it became a proverb: ‘Is Saul also among
         the prophets?’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant: ‘Whither went ye?’ And he said: ‘To seek the asses; and when we saw that
         they were not found, we came to Samuel.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Saul’s uncle said: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And Saul said unto his uncle: ‘He told us plainly that the asses were found.’ But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof
         Samuel spoke, he told him not.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Samuel called the people together unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> to Mizpah. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And he said unto the children of Israel: ‘Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the
         hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you. <span class="verse-number">19</span>But ye have this day rejected your God, who Himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have
         said unto Him: Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> by your tribes, and by your thousands.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families, and the family of the 
         Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they sought him, he could not be found. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Therefore they asked of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> further: ‘Is there yet a man come hither?’ And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> answered: ‘Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders
         and upward. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And Samuel said to all the people: ‘See ye him whom the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?’ And all the people shouted, and said: ‘Long live the king.’
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">25</span>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the men of valour, whose hearts God had touched. <span class="verse-number">27</span>But certain base fellows said: ‘How shall this man save us?’ And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he was
         as one that held his peace.

            									Chapter 11
         </h3>Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash: ‘Make a
         covenant with us, and we will serve thee.’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them: ‘On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and
         I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the 
         
         
         
         
         elders of Jabesh said unto him: ‘Give us seven days’respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and
         then, if there be none to deliver us, we will come out to thee.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then came the messengers to Gibeath-shaul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their
         voice, and wept. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said: ‘What aileth the people that they weep?’ And they
         told him the words of the men of Jabesh. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers,
         saying: ‘Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.’ And the dread of the
         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> fell on the people, and they came out as one man. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And they said unto the messengers that came: ‘Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead: To-morrow, by the time the
         sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance.’ And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the men of Jabesh said: ‘To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.’

         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the
         morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day; and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered,
         so that two of them were not left together. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And the people said unto Samuel: ‘Who is he that said: Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.’
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And Saul said: ‘There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath wrought deliverance in Israel.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>Then said Samuel to the people: ‘Come and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

            									Chapter 12
         </h3>And Samuel said unto all Israel: ‘Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king
         over you. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you; and I have walked
         before you from my youth unto this day. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Here I am; witness against me before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and before His anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? or whom have I oppressed?
         
         
         
         
         
         or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And they said: ‘Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man’s hand.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>And he said unto them: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand.’ And they said: ‘He
         is witness.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Samuel said unto the people: ‘It is the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> that made Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> concerning all the righteous acts of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which He did to you and to your fathers. <span class="verse-number">8</span>When Jacob was come into Egypt, then your fathers cried unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and they were made to dwell in this place. <span class="verse-number">9</span>But they forgot the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, and He gave them over into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines,
         and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And they cried unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: We have sinned, because we have forsaken the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve Thee.
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your 
         enemies on every side, and ye dwelt in safety. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me: Nay, but a king shall reign
         over us; when the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God was your king. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for; and, behold, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath set a king over you. <span class="verse-number">14</span>If ye will fear the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and serve Him, and hearken unto His voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God—; <span class="verse-number">15</span>but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, but rebel against the commandment of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, then shall the hand of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> be against you, and against your fathers. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will do before your eyes. <span class="verse-number">17</span>Is it not wheat harvest to-day?

         aside from following the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, but serve the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> with all your heart; <span class="verse-number">21</span>and turn ye not aside; for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain. <span class="verse-number">22</span>For the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will not forsake His people for His great name’s sake; because it hath pleased the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> to make you a people unto Himself. <span class="verse-number">23</span>Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and the right way. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Only fear the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things He hath done for you. <span class="verse-number">25</span>But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be swept away, both ye and your king.’

         <span class="verse-number">6</span>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait—for the people were distressed—then the people did hide themselves in

         were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmas.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 14
         </h3>Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bore his armour: ‘Come and let us go over
         to the Philistines’garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron; and the people that were with
         him were about six hundred men, <span class="verse-number">3</span>and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one
         side, and a rocky 
         
         
         
         
         crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. <span class="verse-number">5</span>The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmas, and the other on the south in front of Geba.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour: ‘Come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised;
         it may be that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will work for us; for there is no restraint to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> to save by many or by few.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>And his armour-bearer said unto him: ‘Do all that is in thy heart; turn thee, behold I am with thee according to thy heart.’
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>Then said Jonathan: ‘Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them. <span class="verse-number">9</span>If they say thus unto us: Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
         <span class="verse-number">10</span>But if they say thus: Come up unto us; then we will go up; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath delivered them into our hand; and this shall be the sign unto us.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said: ‘Behold Hebrews coming
         forth out of the holes where they hid themselves.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan and his armour-bearer, and said: ‘Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.’
         And Jonathan said unto his armour-bearer: ‘Come up after me; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour-bearer after him; and they 
         fell before Jonathan; and his armour-bearer slew them after him. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s
         length in an acre of land. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And there was a trembling in the camp in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled;
         and the earth quaked; so it grew into a terror from God. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeath-benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went hither and thither.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>Then said Saul unto the people that were with him: ‘Number now, and see who is gone from us.’ And when they had numbered,
         behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And Saul said unto Ahijah: ‘Bring hither the ark of God.’ For the ark of God was there at that time with the children of Israel.
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and
         increased; and Saul said unto the priest: ‘Withdraw thy hand.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and, behold, every man’s sword
         was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture. <span class="verse-number">21</span>Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp round about; even they
         also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and 
         
         
         
         
         Jonathan. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines
         fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. <span class="verse-number">23</span>So the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> saved Israel that day; and the battle passed on as far as Beth-aven.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the men of Israel were distressed that day; but Saul adjured the people, saying: ‘Cursed be the man that eateth any food
         until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies.’ So none of the people tasted food. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And when the people were come unto the forest, behold a flow of honey; but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people
         feared the oath. <span class="verse-number">27</span>But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath; and he put forth the end of the rod that was in his
         hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened. <span class="verse-number">28</span>Then answered one of the people, and said: ‘Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man
         that eateth food this day; and the people are faint.’ <span class="verse-number">29</span>Then said Jonathan: ‘My father hath troubled the land; see, I pray you, how mine eyes are brightened, because I tasted a little
         of this honey. <span class="verse-number">30</span>How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? had there not been
         then a much greater slaughter 
         among the Philistines?’ <span class="verse-number">31</span>And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmas to Aijalon; and the people were very faint. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did
         eat them with the blood. <span class="verse-number">33</span>Then they told Saul, saying: ‘Behold, the people sin against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, in that they eat with the blood.’ And he said: ‘Ye have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone unto me this day.’ <span class="verse-number">34</span>And Saul said: ‘Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them: Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his
         sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in eating with the blood.’ And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there. <span class="verse-number">35</span>And Saul built an altar unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; the same was the first altar that he built unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">36</span>And Saul said: ‘Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave
         a man of them.’ And they said: ‘Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee.’ Then said the priest: ‘Let us draw near hither unto
         God.’ <span class="verse-number">37</span>And Saul asked counsel of God: ‘Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?’ But
         He answered him not that day. <span class="verse-number">38</span>And Saul said: ‘Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. <span class="verse-number">39</span>For, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, who saveth 
         
         
         
         
         Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.’ But there was not a man among all the people that answered
         him. <span class="verse-number">40</span>Then said he unto all Israel: ‘Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.’ And the people said
         unto Saul: ‘Do what seemeth good unto thee.’ <span class="verse-number">41</span>Therefore Saul said unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: ‘Declare the right.’ And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot; but the people escaped. <span class="verse-number">42</span>And Saul said: ‘Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.’ And Jonathan was taken. <span class="verse-number">43</span>Then Saul said to Jonathan: ‘Tell me what thou hast done.’ And Jonathan told him, and said: ‘I did certainly taste a little
         honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; here am I: I will die.’ <span class="verse-number">44</span>And Saul said: ‘God do so and more also; thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.’ <span class="verse-number">45</span>And the people said unto Saul: ‘Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it; as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day.’ So the people rescued
         Jonathan, that he died not. <span class="verse-number">46</span>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">47</span>So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children
         of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he 
         turned himself, he put them to the worse. <span class="verse-number">48</span>And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

         <span class="verse-number">49</span>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of

            									Chapter 15
         </h3>And Samuel said unto Saul: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent me to anoint thee to be king over His people, over Israel; now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Thus saith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and
         suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.’  
         
         
         
         
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Saul said unto the Kenites: ‘Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye
         showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.’ So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is in front of Egypt. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. <span class="verse-number">9</span>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, even the young of the second birth, and the
         lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; but every thing that was of no account and feeble, that
         they destroyed utterly.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">10</span>Then came the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> unto Samuel, saying: <span class="verse-number">11</span>‘It repenteth Me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following Me, and hath not performed My commandments.’
         And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> all night. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying: ‘Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he is
         setting him up a monument, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.’ 
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him: ‘Blessed be thou of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; I have performed the commandment of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And Samuel said: ‘What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Saul said: ‘They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to
         sacrifice unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then Samuel said unto Saul: ‘Stay, and I will tell thee what the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath said to me this night.’ And he said unto him: ‘Say on.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Because thou hast rejected the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, He hath also rejected thee from being king.’ <span class="verse-number">24</span>And Saul said unto Samuel: ‘I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and thy words; because I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice. <span class="verse-number">25</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ <span class="verse-number">26</span>And Samuel said unto Saul: ‘I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And Samuel said unto him: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.
         <span class="verse-number">29</span>And also the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent; for He is not a man, that He should repent.’ <span class="verse-number">30</span>Then he said: ‘I have sinned; yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and return
         with me, that I may worship the 
         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God.’ <span class="verse-number">31</span>So Samuel returned after Saul; and Saul worshipped the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">32</span>Then said Samuel: ‘Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.’ And Agag came unto him in chains. And Agag said:
         ‘Surely the bitterness of death is at hand.’ <span class="verse-number">33</span>And Samuel said:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>As thy sword hath made women childless,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>So shall thy mother be childless among women.  And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Gilgal.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">34</span>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeath-shaul. <span class="verse-number">35</span>And Samuel never beheld Saul again until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 16
         </h3>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Samuel: ‘How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn
         with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided Me a king among his sons.’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Samuel said: ‘How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.’ And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: ‘Take a heifer with thee, and say: I am come to sacrifice to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto Me him whom I name unto
         thee.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Samuel did that which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the 
         
         
         
         
         elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said: ‘Comest thou peaceably?’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>And he said: ‘Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.’ And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he beheld Eliab, and said: ‘Surely the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> anointed is before Him.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>But the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto Samuel: ‘Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not
         as man seeth: for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> looketh on the heart.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said: ‘Neither hath the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this.’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said: ‘Neither hath the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath not chosen these.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Samuel said unto Jesse: ‘Are here all thy children?’ And he said: ‘There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth
         the sheep.’ And Samuel said unto Jesse: ‘Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of beautiful eyes, and goodly to look upon. And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: ‘Arise, anoint him; for this is he.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his 
         brethren; and the spirit of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>Now the spirit of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> terrified him. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Saul’s servants said unto him: ‘Behold now, an evil spirit from God terrifieth thee. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp; and it
         shall be, when the evil spirit from God cometh upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Saul said unto his servants: ‘Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then answered one of the young men, and said: ‘Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing,
         and a mighty man of valour, and a man of war, and prudent in affairs, and a comely person, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is with him.’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said: ‘Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying: ‘Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David 
         
         
         
         
         took the harp, and played with his hand; so Saul found relief, and it was well with him, and the evil spirit departed from
         him.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 17
         </h3>Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to
         Judah, and pitched between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against
         the Philistines. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side; and there was
         a valley between them. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a
         span. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand
         shekels of brass. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer
         went before him. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them: ‘Why do ye come out to set your battle in array? am
         not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. <span class="verse-number">9</span>If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will 
         we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the Philistine said: ‘I do taunt the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons; and the man
         was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons that went to the battle
         were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.—<span class="verse-number">15</span>Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Beth-lehem.—<span class="verse-number">16</span>And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Jesse said unto David his son: ‘Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and carry
         them quickly to the camp to thy brethren. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and to thy brethren shalt thou bring greetings, and take their
         pledge; <span class="verse-number">19</span>now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, are in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And David rose up early in the 
         
         
         
         
         morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the barricade, as
         the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brethren.
         <span class="verse-number">23</span>And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks
         of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words; and David heard them. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And the men of Israel said: ‘Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to taunt Israel is he come up; and it shall be,
         that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s
         house free in Israel.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying: ‘What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh
         away the taunt from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should have taunted the armies of the living
         God?’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>And the people answered him after this manner, saying: ‘So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.’ <span class="verse-number">28</span>And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled 
         against David, and he said: ‘Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know
         thy presumptuousness, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.’ <span class="verse-number">29</span>And David said: ‘What have I now done? Was it not but a word?’ <span class="verse-number">30</span>And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner; and the people answered him after the former
         manner.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">31</span>And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he was taken to him. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And David said to Saul: ‘Let no man’s heart fail within him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.’ <span class="verse-number">33</span>And Saul said to David: ‘Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and
         he a man of war from his youth.’ <span class="verse-number">34</span>And David said unto Saul: ‘Thy servant kept his father’s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out
         of the flock, <span class="verse-number">35</span>I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his
         beard, and smote him, and slew him. <span class="verse-number">36</span>Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath taunted
         the armies of the living God.’ <span class="verse-number">37</span>And David said: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver 
         
         
         
         
         me out of the hand of this Philistine.’ And Saul said unto David: ‘Go, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> shall be with thee.’ <span class="verse-number">38</span>And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail. <span class="verse-number">39</span>And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he essayed to go [, but could not]; for he had not tried it. And David said
         unto Saul: ‘I cannot go with these; for I have not tried them.’ And David put them off him. <span class="verse-number">40</span>And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which
         he had, even in his scrip; and his sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">41</span>And the Philistine came nearer and nearer unto David; and the man that bore the shield went before him. <span class="verse-number">42</span>And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a
         fair countenance. <span class="verse-number">43</span>And the Philistine said unto David: ‘Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?’ And the Philistine cursed David by his
         god. <span class="verse-number">44</span>And the Philistine said to David: ‘Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the
         field.’ <span class="verse-number">45</span>Then said David to the Philistine: ‘Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to thee
         in the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast taunted. <span class="verse-number">46</span>This day will the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> deliver thee into my hand; and I 
         will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto
         the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel; <span class="verse-number">47</span>and that all this assembly may know that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span>, and He will give you into our hand.’ <span class="verse-number">48</span>And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward
         the army to meet the Philistine. <span class="verse-number">49</span>And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slung it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the
         stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth. <span class="verse-number">50</span>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was
         no sword in the hand of David. <span class="verse-number">51</span>And David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and
         cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their mighty man was dead, they fled. <span class="verse-number">52</span>And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates
         of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. <span class="verse-number">53</span>And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the 
         
         
         
         
         Philistines, and they spoiled their camp. <span class="verse-number">54</span>And David took the head of the philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">55</span>And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host: ‘Abner, whose son is
         this youth?’ And Abner said: ‘As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.’ <span class="verse-number">56</span>And the king said: ‘Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.’ <span class="verse-number">57</span>And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the
         Philistine in his hand. <span class="verse-number">58</span>And Saul said to him: ‘Whose son art thou, thou young man?’ And David answered: ‘I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.’
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 18
         </h3>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,
         and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and
         to his bow, and to his girdle. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And David went out; whithersoever Saul sent him, he had good success; and Saul set him over the men of war; and it was good
         
         in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all
         the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with three-stringed instruments.
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the women sang one to another in their play, and said:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Saul hath slain his thousands,

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said: ‘They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to
         me they have ascribed but thousands; and all he lacketh is the kingdom! ’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">10</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the
         house; and David played with his hand, as he did day by day; and Saul had his spear in his hand. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Saul cast the spear; for he said: ‘I will smite David even to the wall.’ And David stepped aside out of his presence twice.
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Saul was afraid of David, because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with him, and was departed from Saul. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>And David had great success in all his ways; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with him. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood 
         
         
         
         
         in awe of him. <span class="verse-number">16</span>But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Saul said to David: ‘Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife; only be thou valiant for me, and fight
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> battles.’ For Saul said: ‘Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And David said unto Saul: ‘Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to
         the king?’ <span class="verse-number">19</span>But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel
         the Meholathite to wife. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And Saul said: ‘I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.’
         Wherefore Saul said to David: ‘Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law through the one of the twain.’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>And Saul commanded his servants: ‘Speak with David secretly, and say: Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants
         love thee; now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said: ‘Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king’s
         son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?’ <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the servants of Saul told him, saying: ‘On this manner spoke David.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>And Saul said: ‘Thus shall ye say to David: The 
         king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.’ For Saul thought
         to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. And the days were not expired;
         <span class="verse-number">27</span>and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins,
         and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter
         to wife. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And Saul saw and knew that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with David; and Michal Saul’s daughter loved him. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">30</span>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David prospered more

            									Chapter 19
         </h3>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David; but Jonathan Saul’s son delighted
         much in David. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Jonathan told David, saying: ‘Saul my father seeketh to slay thee; now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in
         the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will speak with my 
         
         
         
         
         father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Jonathan spoke good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him: ‘Let not the king sin against his servant, against
         David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his work hath been very good towards thee; <span class="verse-number">5</span>for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> wrought a great victory for all Israel; thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent
         blood, to slay David without a cause?’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore: ‘As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, he shall not be put to death.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all those things.

         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And there was war again; and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they
         fled before him. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And an evil spirit from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the
         spear into the wall; and David fled, and escaped that night. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Saul sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning; and Michal David’s wife told him,
         saying: ‘If thou save not thy life 
         to-night, to-morrow thou shalt be slain.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>So Michal let David down through the window; and he went, and fled, and escaped. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a quilt of goats’hair at the head thereof, and covered it with
         a cloth. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said: ‘He is sick.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying: ‘Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the quilt of goats’hair at the head thereof. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Saul said unto Michal: ‘Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, that he is escaped?’ And Michal answered
         Saul: ‘He said unto me: Let me go; why should I kill thee?’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
         and dwelt in Naioth. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And it was told Saul, saying: ‘Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as
         head over them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time,
         and they also prophesied. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great 
         
         
         
         
         cistern that is in Secu; and he asked and said: ‘Where are Samuel and David?’ And one said: ‘Behold, they are at Naioth in
         Ramah.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah; and the spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he
         came to Naioth in Ramah. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.
         Wherefore they say: ‘Is Saul also among the prophets?’

            									Chapter 20
         </h3>And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan: ‘What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what
         is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he said unto him: ‘Far from it; thou shalt not die; behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he
         discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And David swore moreover, and said: ‘Thy father knoweth well that I have found favour in thine eyes; and he saith: Let not
         Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved; but truly as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then said Jonathan unto David: ‘What doth thy soul desire, that I should do it for thee?’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>And David said unto Jonathan: ‘Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, when I should sit with the king to eat; so let me go, that
         I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even. <span class="verse-number">6</span>If thy father miss me at all, then say: 
         David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the
         family. <span class="verse-number">7</span>If he say thus: It is well; thy servant shall have peace; but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> with thee; but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And Jonathan said: ‘Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee,
         then would not I tell it thee? <span class="verse-number">10</span>Then said David to Jonathan: ‘Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Jonathan said unto David: ‘Come and let us go out into the field.’ And they went out both of them into the field.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Jonathan said unto David: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel—when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward
         David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee? <span class="verse-number">13</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee
         away, that thou mayest go in peace; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> be with thee, as He hath been with my father. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that I die not; <span class="verse-number">15</span>but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, 
         
         
         
         
         not when the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>And Jonathan said unto him: ‘To-morrow is the new moon; and thou wilt be missed, thy seat will be empty. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And in the third day thou shalt hide thyself well, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself in the day of work,
         and shalt remain by the stone Ezel. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And I will shoot three arrows to the side-ward, as though I shot at a mark. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And, behold, I will send the lad: Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad: Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee;
         take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth. <span class="verse-number">22</span>But if I say thus unto the boy: Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath sent thee away. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And as touching the matter which I and thou have spoken of, behold, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is between me and thee for ever.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">24</span>So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to the meal to eat. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by
         Saul’s side; but David’s place was empty. <span class="verse-number">26</span>Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day; for he 
         thought: ‘Something hath befallen him, he is unclean; surely he is not clean.’ <span class="verse-number">27</span>And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David’s place was empty; and Saul said
         unto Jonathan his son: ‘Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to the meal, neither yesterday, nor to-day?’ <span class="verse-number">28</span>And Jonathan answered Saul: ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem; <span class="verse-number">29</span>and he said: Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me; and
         now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto
         the king’s table.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">30</span>Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him: ‘Thou son of perverse rebellion, do not I know that
         thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother’s nakedness? <span class="verse-number">31</span>For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send
         and fetch him unto me, for he deserveth to die.’ <span class="verse-number">32</span>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him: ‘Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?’ <span class="verse-number">33</span>And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death.
         <span class="verse-number">34</span>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second 
         
         
         
         
         day of the month; for he was grieved for David, and because his father had put him to shame.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">35</span>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad
         with him. <span class="verse-number">36</span>And he said unto his lad: ‘Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.’ And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. <span class="verse-number">37</span>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said: ‘Is not
         the arrow beyond thee?’ <span class="verse-number">38</span>And Jonathan cried after the lad: ‘Make speed, hasten, stay not.’ And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
         master. <span class="verse-number">39</span>But the lad knew not any thing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter. <span class="verse-number">40</span>And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him: ‘Go, carry them to the city.’ <span class="verse-number">41</span>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed
         down three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded. <span class="verse-number">42</span>And Jonathan said to David: ‘Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> shall be between me and thee, and  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 21
         </h3>Between my seed and thy seed, for ever.’ <span class="verse-number">1</span>And he arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech  
         came to meet David trembling, and said unto him: ‘Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?’ <span class="verse-number">3</span> And David said unto Ahimelech the priest: ‘The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me: Let no man know
         any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee; and the young men have I appointed to such
         and such a place. <span class="verse-number">4</span> Now therefore what is under thy hand? five loaves of bread? give them in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the priest answered David, and said: ‘There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young
         men have kept themselves from women.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span> And David answered the priest, and said unto him: ‘Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I
         came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day, when there
         shall be holy bread in their vessels?’ <span class="verse-number">7</span> So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.—<span class="verse-number">8</span> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.—<span class="verse-number">9</span> And David said unto Ahimelech: ‘And is there peradventure here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought
         my sword 
         
         
         
         
         nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the priest said: ‘The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped
         in a cloth behind the ephod; if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here.’ And David said: ‘There
         is none like that; give it me.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And the servants of Achish said unto him: ‘Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him
         in dances, saying:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Saul hath slain his thousands,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And David his ten thousands?’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And he changed his demeanour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
         and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. <span class="verse-number">15</span>Then said Achish unto his servants: ‘Lo, when ye see a man that is mad, wherefore do ye bring him to me? <span class="verse-number">16</span>Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?’

         </h3>David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard
         it, they went down thither to 
         him. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves
         unto him; and he became captain over them; and there were with him about four hundred men.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab; and he said unto the king of Moab: ‘Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come
         forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And he brought them before the king of Moab; and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the prophet Gad said unto David: ‘Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah.’ Then David
         departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him; now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree
         in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him: ‘Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you
         fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds; <span class="verse-number">8</span>that all of you have conspired against me, and there was none that disclosed it to me when my son made a league with the son
         of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath 
         
         
         
         
         stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said: ‘I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to
         Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And he inquired of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nob;
         and they came all of them to the king. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Saul said: ‘Hear now, thou son of Ahitub.’ And he answered: ‘Here I am, my lord.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>And Saul said unto him: ‘Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and
         a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said: ‘And who among all thy servants is so trusted as David, who is the king’s son-in-law,
         and giveth heed unto thy bidding, and is honourable in thy house? <span class="verse-number">15</span>Have I to-day begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me; let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor
         to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And the king said: ‘Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>And the king said unto the guard that stood about him: ‘Turn, and slay the priests of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; because their hand also is 
         with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me.’ But the servants of the king would not put
         forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And the king said to Doeg: ‘Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.’ And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests,
         and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen
         and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> priests. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And David said unto Abiathar: ‘I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul; I have

         by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And David knew that Saul devised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest: ‘Bring hither the ephod.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>Then said David: ‘O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, Thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as Thy servant hath heard?’ O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, I beseech Thee, tell Thy servant.’ And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: ‘He will come down.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>Then said David: ‘Will the men of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul?’ And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: ‘They will deliver thee 
         up.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go.
         And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbore to go forth.

         up into the king’s hand.’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>And Saul said: ‘Blessed be ye of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for ye have had compassion on me. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Go, I pray you, make yet more

         </div>Sela-hammahlekoth. <span class="verse-number">1</span>And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying: ‘Behold, David is
         in the wilderness of En-gedi.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild
         goats. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were
         sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the men of David said unto him: ‘Behold the day in which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath said unto thee: Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto
         thee.’ Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And he said unto his men: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> forbid it me, that I should do this thing unto my lord, the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> anointed.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and
         went on his way.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying: ‘My lord the king.’ And when Saul looked
         behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and prostrated himself. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And David said to Saul: ‘Wherefore hearkenest thou to 
         
         
         
         
         men’s words, saying: Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? <span class="verse-number">11</span>Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and some bade me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said: I will
         not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> anointed. <span class="verse-number">12</span>Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed
         thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though
         thou layest wait for my soul to take it. <span class="verse-number">13</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> judge between me and thee, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee. <span class="verse-number">14</span>As saith the proverb of the ancients: Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee. <span class="verse-number">15</span>After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. <span class="verse-number">16</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.’
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said: ‘Is this thy voice, my
         son David?’ And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And he said to David: ‘Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee
         evil. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And thou hast declared this day how that thou 
         hast dealt well with me; forasmuch as when the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had delivered me up into thy hand, thou didst not kill me. <span class="verse-number">20</span>For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Swear now therefore unto me by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And David swore unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got them up unto the stronghold.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 25
         </h3>And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And
         David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
         and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful
         form; but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And David sent ten young men, and David said unto 
         
         
         
         
         the young men: ‘Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name; <span class="verse-number">6</span>and thus ye shall say: All hail! and peace be both unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And now I have heard that thou hast shearers; thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there
         aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee; wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes; for we come on a good day;
         give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said: ‘Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days
         that break away every man from his master; <span class="verse-number">11</span>shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I
         know not whence they are?’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And David said unto his men: ‘Gird ye on every man his sword.’ And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded
         on his sword; and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">14</span>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying: ‘Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute
         our master; and he flew upon them. <span class="verse-number">15</span>But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we went with them, when
         we were in the fields; <span class="verse-number">16</span>they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. <span class="verse-number">17</span>Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for
         he is such a base fellow, that one cannot speak to him.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures
         of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And she said unto her young men: ‘Go on before me; behold, I come after you.’ But she told not her husband Nabal. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down
         towards her; and she met them.—<span class="verse-number">21</span>Now David had said: ‘Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of
         all that pertained unto him; and he hath returned me evil for good. <span class="verse-number">22</span>God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning 
         
         
         
         
         light so much as one male.’—<span class="verse-number">23</span>And when Abigail saw David, she made haste, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed down to
         the ground. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And she fell at his feet, and said: ‘Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in
         thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid. <span class="verse-number">25</span>Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this base fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he:

         <span class="verse-number">26</span>Now therefore, my lord, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from finding redress for thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine
         enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
         <span class="verse-number">28</span>Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and evil is not found in thee all thy days. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And though man be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life

         for myself with mine own hand. <span class="verse-number">34</span>For in very deed, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst made haste and come to meet me, surely
         there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one male.’ <span class="verse-number">35</span>So David received of her hand that which she had brought him; and he said unto her: ‘Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have
         hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">36</span>And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry
         within him, for he was very drunken; wherefore she told 
         
         
         
         
         him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. <span class="verse-number">37</span>And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart
         died within him, and he became as a stone. <span class="verse-number">38</span>And it came to pass about ten days after, that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> smote Nabal, so that he died.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">39</span>And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said: ‘Blessed be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back His servant from evil; and the evil-doing
         of Nabal hath the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> returned upon his own head.’ And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife. <span class="verse-number">40</span>And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying: ‘David hath sent us unto thee,
         to take thee to him to wife.’ <span class="verse-number">41</span>And she arose, and bowed down with her face to the earth, and said: ‘Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of
         the servants of my lord.’ <span class="verse-number">42</span>And Abigail hastened, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the
         messengers of David, and became his wife.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">43</span>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives. <span class="verse-number">44</span>Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.  And the Ziphites came
         unto Saul to Gibeah, saying: ‘Doth 
         not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David
         in the wilderness of Ziph. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he
         saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. <span class="verse-number">4</span>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son
         of Ner, the captain of his host; and Saul lay within the barricade, and the people pitched round about him.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying: ‘Who will
         go down with me to Saul to the camp?’ And Abishai said: ‘I will go down with thee.’ <span class="verse-number">7</span>So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the barricade, with his spear stuck
         in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Then said Abishai to David: ‘God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day; now therefore let me smite him, I pray
         thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And David said to Abishai: ‘Destroy him not; for who can put forth his 
         
         
         
         
         hand against the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> anointed, and be guiltless?’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And David said: ‘As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, nay, but the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle, and be swept away. <span class="verse-number">11</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> forbid it me, that I should put forth my hand against the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> anointed; but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water and let us go.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s head; and they got them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither
         did any awake; for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was fallen upon them.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying: ‘Answerest thou not, Abner?’ Then Abner answered and said:
         ‘Who art thou that criest to the king?’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And David said to Abner: ‘Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept
         watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. <span class="verse-number">16</span>This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, ye deserve to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> anointed. And now, see, where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.’  
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>And Saul knew David’s voice, and said: ‘Is this thy voice, my son David?’ And David said: ‘It is my voice, my lord, O king.’
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>And he said: ‘Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand? <span class="verse-number">19</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> that hath stirred thee up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before
         the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: Go, serve other gods. <span class="verse-number">20</span>Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for the king of Israel is come out to seek a single flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">21</span>Then said Saul: ‘I have sinned; return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine
         eyes this day; behold, I have played the fool and erred exceedingly.’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>And David answered and said: ‘Behold the king’s spear! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against the <span class="small-caps">Lord’s</span> anointed. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the 
         
         
         
         
         eyes of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>Then Saul said to David: ‘Blessed be thou, my son David; thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail.’ So David
         went his way, and Saul returned to his place.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 27
         </h3>And David said in his heart: ‘I shall now be swept away one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than that
         I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel;
         so shall I escape out of his hand.’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam
         the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath; and he sought no more again for him.

         <span class="verse-number">5</span>And David said unto Achish: ‘If now I have found favour in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the
         country, that I may dwell there; for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day; wherefore Ziklag belongeth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four 
         months. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Gizrites, and the Amalekites; for those were the
         inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and
         the camels, and the apparel. And he returned, and came to Achish. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Achish said: ‘Whither have ye made a raid to-day?’ And David said: ‘Against the South of Judah, and against the South
         of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And David left neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying: ‘Lest they should tell on us, saying: So did David,
         and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And Achish believed David, saying: ‘He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant
         for ever.’  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 28
         </h3>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And
         Achish said unto David: ‘Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.’ <span class="verse-number">2</span>And David said to Achish: ‘Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do.’ And Achish said to David: ‘Therefore will
         I make thee keeper of my head for ever.’  
         
         
         
         
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away
         those that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit out of the land. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and
         they pitched in Gilboa. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And when Saul inquired of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Then said Saul unto his servants: ‘Seek me a woman that divineth by a ghost, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.’ And
         his servants said to him: ‘Behold, there is a woman that divineth by a ghost at En-dor.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night;
         and he said: ‘Divine unto me, I pray thee, by a ghost, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And the woman said unto him: ‘Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that divine by a ghost or
         a familiar spirit out of the land; wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Saul swore to her by the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: ‘As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>Then said the woman: ‘Whom shall I bring up unto thee?’ And he 
         said: ‘Bring me up Samuel.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying: ‘Why hast thou deceived me?
         for thou art Saul.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>And the king said unto her: ‘Be not afraid; for what seest thou?’ And the woman said unto Saul: ‘I see a godlike being coming
         up out of the earth.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And he said unto her: ‘What form is he of?’ And she said: ‘An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe.’ And Saul
         perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and prostrated himself.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">15</span>And Samuel said to Saul: ‘Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?’ And Saul answered: ‘I am sore distressed; for the
         Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams;
         therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And Samuel said: ‘Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary? <span class="verse-number">17</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath wrought for Himself; as He spoke by me; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David. <span class="verse-number">18</span>Because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and didst not execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> done this thing unto thee this day. <span class="verse-number">19</span>Moreover the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the 
         
         
         
         
         Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me; the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">20</span>Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel; and there
         was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore affrighted, and said unto him: ‘Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened
         unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spokest unto me. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee;
         and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>But he refused, and said: ‘I will not eat.’ But his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he hearkened unto their
         voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she made haste, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did
         bake unleavened bread thereof; <span class="verse-number">25</span>and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 29
         </h3>Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek; and the Israelites pitched by the fountain which is in Jezreel.
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the lords of the Philistines passed on 
         by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Then said the princes of the Philistines: ‘What do these Hebrews here?’ And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines:
         ‘Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days or these years, and I have found
         no fault in him since he fell away unto me unto this day?’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him: ‘Make the man return,
         that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle
         he become an adversary to us; for wherewith should this fellow reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the
         heads of these men? <span class="verse-number">5</span>Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying:  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Saul hath slain his thousands,  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And David his ten thousands?’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then Achish called David, and said unto him: ‘As the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not
         found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day; nevertheless the lords favour thee not. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>And David said unto Achish: ‘But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy 
         
         
         
         
         servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?’
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And Achish answered and said to David: ‘I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God; notwithstanding the princes
         of the Philistines have said: He shall not go up with us to the battle. <span class="verse-number">10</span>Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up
         early in the morning, and have light, depart.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines
         went up to Jezreel.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 30
         </h3>And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon
         the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; <span class="verse-number">2</span>and had taken captive the women and all that were therein, both small and great; they slew not any, but carried them off,
         and went their way. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters,
         were taken captives. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And David was 
         greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his
         sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> his God.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech: ‘I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod.’ And Abiathar brought
         thither the ephod to David. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And David inquired of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying: ‘Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them?’ And He answered him: ‘Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake
         them, and shalt without fail recover all.’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind
         stayed. <span class="verse-number">10</span>But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the
         brook Besor.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water
         to drink; <span class="verse-number">12</span>and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten, his spirit came back to him;
         for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And David said unto him: ‘To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou?’ And he said: ‘I am a young Egyptian, servant to an
         Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick. <span class="verse-number">14</span>We made a raid upon 
         
         
         
         
         the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with
         fire.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And David said to him: ‘Wilt thou bring me down to this troop?’ And he said: ‘Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither
         kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and feasting,
         because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four
         hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that
         they had taken to them; David brought back all. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said: ‘This is David’s spoil.’
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">21</span>And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide
         at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people 
         that were with him; and when David came near to the people, he saluted them. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said: ‘Because they went not with us,
         we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may
         lead them away, and depart.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>Then said David: ‘Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as is the share of him that goeth down to the battle, so shall be the share
         of him that tarrieth by the baggage; they shall share alike.’ <span class="verse-number">25</span>And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying: ‘Behold a present
         for you of the spoil of the enemies of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>’; <span class="verse-number">27</span>to them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir; <span class="verse-number">28</span>and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa; <span class="verse-number">29</span>and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities
         of the Kenites; <span class="verse-number">30</span>and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-
         
         
         
         
         ashan, and to them that were in Athach; <span class="verse-number">31</span>and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 31
         </h3>Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in
         mount Gilboa. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua,
         the sons of Saul. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And the battle went sore against Saul, an the archers overtook him; and he was in great anguish by reason of the archers.
         <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then said Saul to his armour-bearer: ‘Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust
         me through, and make a mock of me.’ But his armour-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword,
         and fell upon it. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him. <span class="verse-number">6</span>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, and all his men, that same day together. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And when the men of Israel 
         that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that
         Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen
         in mount Gilboa. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the
         tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And they put his armour in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul, <span class="verse-number">12</span>all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan;
         and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
