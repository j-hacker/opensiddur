         <span class="small-caps">Now</span>
         <span class="small-caps"> in</span> the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in
         writing, saying: <span class="verse-number">2</span>‘Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth hath the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Whosoever there is among you of all His people—his God be with him—let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build
         the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, He is the God who is in Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and
         with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.’  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then rose up the heads of fathers’houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God
         had stirred to go up to build the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> which is in Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts,
         and with precious things, 
         beside all that was willingly offered. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; <span class="verse-number">8</span>even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar,
         the prince of Judah. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And this is the number of them: thirty basins of gold, a thousand basins of silver, nine and twenty knives; <span class="verse-number">10</span>thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. <span class="verse-number">11</span>All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred.

         the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.

         with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and harried them while they were building, <span class="verse-number">5</span>and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign
         of Darius king of Persia. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and
         Jerusalem.  <span class="verse-number">7</span>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia;
         and the writing of the letter was written in the Aramaic character, and set forth in the Aramaic tongue. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort—<span class="verse-number">9</span>then wrote Rehum the commander, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinites, and the Apharesattechites,
         the Tarpelites, the Apharesites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the 
         
         
         
         
         
         Dehites, the Elamites, <span class="verse-number">10</span>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asenappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and the rest
         that are in the country beyond the River:— ‘And now—<span class="verse-number">11</span>this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king—thy servants the men beyond the River—and
         now<span class="verse-number">12</span>be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious
         and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and are digging out the foundations. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, impost, or
         toll, and so thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and
         announced to the king, <span class="verse-number">15</span>that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers; so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know
         that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same
         of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste. <span class="verse-number">16</span>We announce to the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond
         the River.’  <span class="verse-number">17</span>Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the commander, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of 
         their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the River: ‘Peace, and now<span class="verse-number">18</span>the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings,
         and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. <span class="verse-number">20</span>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, impost,
         and toll, was paid unto them. <span class="verse-number">21</span>Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And take heed that ye be not slack herein; why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?’  <span class="verse-number">23</span>Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went
         in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius
         king of Persia.

            									Chapter 5
         </h3>Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem;
         in the name of the God of Israel prophesied they unto them. <span class="verse-number">2</span>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is

         thus unto them: ‘Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this structure?’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>‘Then spoke we unto them after this manner [, wrote they]: What are the names of the men that build this building?’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to
         Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.  <span class="verse-number">6</span>The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharesachites,
         who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king; <span class="verse-number">7</span>they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: ‘Unto Darius the king, all peace. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great
         stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus: Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall? <span class="verse-number">10</span>We asked them their names also, to announce to thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them.
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>And thus they returned us answer, saying: 
         We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great
         king of Israel builded and finished. <span class="verse-number">12</span>But because that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
         the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. <span class="verse-number">13</span>But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem,
         and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered
         unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; <span class="verse-number">15</span>and he said unto him: Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded
         in its place. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and since that time even
         until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed. <span class="verse-number">17</span>Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the king’s treasure-house there, which is at Babylon, whether
         it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure
         to us concerning this matter.’

         </h3>Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up, in
         Babylon. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And there was found at Ahmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written: ‘A record.
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house

         cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; <span class="verse-number">4</span>with three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber, and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house; <span class="verse-number">5</span>and also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at

         <span class="verse-number">10</span>that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savour unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
         <span class="verse-number">11</span>Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted
         up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this; <span class="verse-number">12</span>and may the God that hath caused His name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples, that shall put forth their hand

         a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem;

         the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. <span class="verse-number">9</span>For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he
         to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. <span class="verse-number">10</span>For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.  <span class="verse-number">11</span>Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto 
         
         
         
         
         
         Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and of His statutes to Israel: <span class="verse-number">12</span>‘Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, and so forth. And now<span class="verse-number">13</span>I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of
         their own free will to go with thee to Jerusalem, go. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to
         the law of thy God which is in thy hand; <span class="verse-number">15</span>and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation
         is in Jerusalem, <span class="verse-number">16</span>and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people,
         and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem; <span class="verse-number">17</span>therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings,
         and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after

         Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of
         the king’s treasure-house. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra

         of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. <span class="verse-number">23</span>Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there
         be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? <span class="verse-number">24</span>Also we announce to you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this
         house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, impost, or toll, upon them. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people
         that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence,
         whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.’  
         
         
         
         
         
         <span class="verse-number">27</span>Blessed be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> which is in Jerusalem; <span class="verse-number">28</span>and hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king’s mighty princes.

         </h3>Now these are the heads of their fathers’houses, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the

         and fifty. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males. <span class="verse-number">5</span>Of the sons of Shechaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him fourscore males. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him a 
         hundred and threescore males. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty and eight males. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him a hundred and ten males. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And of the sons of Adonikam, that were the last; and these are their names, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah; and with them
         threescore males. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur; and with him seventy males.  <span class="verse-number">15</span>And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days; and I viewed the people,
         and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for
         Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, teachers. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And I gave them commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo [and]
         his brother, who were set over the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi,
         the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; <span class="verse-number">19</span>and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; <span class="verse-number">20</span>and of the Nethinim, whom David and the 
         
         
         
         
         
         princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim; all of them were mentioned by name.  <span class="verse-number">21</span>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a straight
         way, for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. <span class="verse-number">22</span>For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; because we had
         spoken unto the king, saying: ‘The hand of our God is upon all them that seek Him, for good; but His power and His wrath is
         against all them that forsake Him.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>So we fasted and besought our God for this; and He was entreated of us. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Then I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, besides Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, <span class="verse-number">25</span>and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king,
         and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered; <span class="verse-number">26</span>I even weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred
         talents; <span class="verse-number">27</span>and twenty bowels of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And I said unto them: ‘Ye are holy unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers. <span class="verse-number">29</span>Watch ye, and keep them, until ye 
         weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’houses of Israel, at Jerusalem,
         in the chambers of the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ <span class="verse-number">30</span>So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem
         unto the house of our God.  <span class="verse-number">31</span>Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem; and the hand of our
         God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and lier-in-wait by the way. <span class="verse-number">32</span>And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth
         the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and
         Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levites; <span class="verse-number">34</span>the whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written at that time.  <span class="verse-number">35</span>The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks
         for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering; all this was a burnt-offering
         unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">36</span>And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors beyond the River; and they furthered
         the people and the house of God.  
         
         
         
         
         
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 9
         </h3>Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto me, saying: ‘The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites,
         have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites,
         the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. <span class="verse-number">2</span>For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons; so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with
         the peoples of the lands; yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been first in this faithlessness.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat
         down appalled. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of them
         of the captivity; and I sat appalled until the evening offering.  <span class="verse-number">5</span>And at the evening offering I arose up from my fasting, even with my garment and my mantle rent; and I fell upon my knees,
         and spread out my hands unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God; <span class="verse-number">6</span>and I said: ‘O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to Thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our
         head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens. <span class="verse-number">7</span>Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and
         
         our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to spoiling, and to confusion
         of face, as it is this day. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And now for a little moment grace hath been shown from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in His holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and
         give us a little reviving in our bondage. <span class="verse-number">9</span>For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings
         of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a fence
         in Judah and in Jerusalem. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken Thy commandments, <span class="verse-number">11</span>which Thou hast commanded by Thy servants the prophets, saying: The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land
         through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, wherewith they have filled it from one end
         to another with their filthiness. <span class="verse-number">12</span>Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or
         their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
         for ever. <span class="verse-number">13</span>And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that Thou our God hast punished us
         less than our 
         
         
         
         
         
         iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant, <span class="verse-number">14</span>shall we again break Thy commandments, and make marriages with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not Thou be
         angry with us till Thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape? <span class="verse-number">15</span>O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, Thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day; behold, we are before
         Thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before Thee because of this.’  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 10
         </h3>Now while Ezra prayed, and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together
         unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra: ‘We have broken faith with our God,
         and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the
         counsel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee; be of good courage, and do it.’  <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and 
         all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore. <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came
         thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the faithlessness of them of the captivity. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather
         themselves together unto Jerusalem; <span class="verse-number">8</span>and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should
         be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of the captivity.  <span class="verse-number">9</span>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth
         month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because
         of this matter, and for the great rain. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them: ‘Ye have broken faith, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt
         of Israel. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Now therefore make confession unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers, and do His pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign
         women.’ <span class="verse-number">12</span>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice: ‘As thou hast said, so it is for us to do. <span class="verse-number">13</span>But the people are 
         
         
         
         
         
         many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two; for we
         have greatly transgressed in this matter. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Let now our princes of all the congregation stand, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women
         come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God
         be turned from us, as touching this matter.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this matter; and Meshullam and Shabbethai
         the Levite helped them. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers’houses, after their fathers’houses,
         and all of them by their names, were separated; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
         <span class="verse-number">17</span>And they were finished with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.  <span class="verse-number">18</span>And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women, namely: of the sons of Jeshua, the son
         of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, [they offered] a ram of the flock for their
         guilt. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, and Elijah, 
         and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah. <span class="verse-number">22</span>And of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah—the same is Kelita—Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. <span class="verse-number">24</span>And of the singers: Eliashib; and of the porters: Shallum, and Telem, and Uri. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And of Israel: of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, and Izziah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah. <span class="verse-number">27</span>And of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza. <span class="verse-number">28</span>And of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai. <span class="verse-number">29</span>And of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth. <span class="verse-number">30</span>And of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, and Binnui, and Manasseh. <span class="verse-number">31</span>And of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon; <span class="verse-number">32</span>Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah. <span class="verse-number">33</span>Of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei. <span class="verse-number">34</span>Of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, and Uel; <span class="verse-number">35</span>Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhu; <span class="verse-number">36</span>Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib; <span class="verse-number">37</span>Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasai; <span class="verse-number">38</span>and Bani, and Binnui, Shimei; <span class="verse-number">39</span>Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah; <span class="verse-number">40</span>Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai; <span class="verse-number">41</span>Azarel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah;
