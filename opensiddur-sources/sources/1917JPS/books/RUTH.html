            									Chapter 1
         </h3>
         <span class="small-caps">And</span>
         <span class="small-caps"> it</span> came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem in
         Judah went to sojourn in the field of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites
         of Beth-lehem in Judah. And they came into the field of Moab, and continued there. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And they took them wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they dwelt
         there about ten years. <span class="verse-number">5</span>And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband. <span class="verse-number">6</span>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the field of Moab; for she had heard in the field of
         Moab how that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had remembered His people in giving them bread. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return
         unto the land of Judah. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law: ‘Go, return each of you to her mother’s house; the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. <span class="verse-number">9</span>The 
         <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.’ Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their
         voice, and wept. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And they said unto her: ‘Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Naomi said: ‘Turn back, my daughters; why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
         <span class="verse-number">12</span>Turn back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say: I have hope, should I even have
         an husband to-night, and also bear sons; <span class="verse-number">13</span>would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye shut yourselves off for them and have no husbands? nay, my daughters;
         for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is gone forth against me.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved unto her. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And she said: ‘Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god; return thou after thy sister-in-law.’
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>And Ruth said: ‘Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go;
         and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; <span class="verse-number">17</span>where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> do so to me, 
         
         
         
         
         and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her. <span class="verse-number">19</span>So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city
         was astir concerning them, and the women said: ‘Is this Naomi?’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And she said unto them: ‘Call me not

         </div>Marah; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. <span class="verse-number">21</span>I went out full, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath brought me back home empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the field of Moab—and they came
         to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 2
         </h3>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of valour, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi: ‘Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of corn after him in whose sight
         I shall find favour.’ And she said unto her: ‘Go, my daughter.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging
         unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And, behold, 
         Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> be with you.’ And they answered him: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> bless thee.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers: ‘Whose damsel is this?’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said: ‘It is a Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of
         the field of Moab; <span class="verse-number">7</span>and she said: Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves; so she came, and hath continued even
         from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>Then said Boaz unto Ruth: ‘Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide
         here fast by my maidens. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men that they shall
         not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>Then she fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground, and said unto him: ‘Why have I found favour in thy sight, that thou
         shouldest take cognizance of me, seeing I am a foreigner?’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And Boaz answered and said unto her: ‘It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the
         death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
         people that thou knewest not 
         
         
         
         
         heretofore. <span class="verse-number">12</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> recompense thy work, and be thy reward complete from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>Then she said: ‘Let me find favour in thy sight, my <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy
         handmaidens.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: ‘Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.’ And she sat beside
         the reapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying: ‘Let her glean even among the sheaves, and put her
         not to shame. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And also pull out some for her of purpose from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.’ <span class="verse-number">17</span>So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave
         to her that which she had left after she was satisfied. <span class="verse-number">19</span>And her mother-in-law said unto her: ‘Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
         knowledge of thee.’ And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said: ‘The man’s name with whom I wrought
         to-day is Boaz.’ <span class="verse-number">20</span>And Naomi 
         said unto her daughter-in-law: ‘Blessed be he of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who hath not left off His kindness to the living and to the dead.’ And Naomi said unto her: ‘The man is nigh of kin unto
         us, one of our near kinsmen.’ <span class="verse-number">21</span>And Ruth the Moabitess said: ‘Yea, he said unto me: Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.’
         <span class="verse-number">22</span>And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law: ‘It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that thou be
         not met in any other field.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her
         mother-in-law.  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 3
         </h3>And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her: ‘My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? <span class="verse-number">2</span>And now is there not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.
         <span class="verse-number">3</span>Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor; but make
         not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover
         his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>And she said unto her: ‘All that thou sayest unto me I will do.’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And she went down unto the threshing-
         
         
         
         
         floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn; and she came
         softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And he said: ‘Who art thou?’ And she answered: ‘I am Ruth thine handmaid; spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for
         thou art a near kinsman.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And he said: ‘Blessed be thou of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, my daughter; thou hast shown more kindness in the end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow the young
         men, whether poor or rich. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the men in the gate of my people do know that
         thou art a virtuous woman. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. <span class="verse-number">13</span>Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do
         the kinsman’s part; but if he be not willing to do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to
         thee, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> liveth; lie down until the morning.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said: ‘Let it not be known
         that the woman came to the threshing-floor.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>And he said: ‘Bring 
         the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it’; and she held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; and
         he went into the city. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said: ‘Who art thou, my daughter?’ And she told her all that the man had done
         to her. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And she said: ‘These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me: Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>Then said she: ‘Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have
         finished the thing this day.’  
         <h3>
            									Chapter 4
         </h3>Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there; and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom
         he said: ‘Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.’ And he turned aside, and sat down. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: ‘Sit ye down here.’ And they sat down. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And he said unto the near kinsman: ‘Naomi, that is come back out of the field of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was
         our brother Elimelech’s; <span class="verse-number">4</span>and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying: Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou
         wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if it will not be redeemed, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it beside
         thee; and I am after thee.’ And he said: ‘I will redeem it.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then said Boaz: ‘What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi—hast thou also 
         
         
         
         
         bought of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance?’ <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the near kinsman said: ‘I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance; take thou my right of redemption
         on thee; for I cannot redeem it.’—<span class="verse-number">7</span>Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a
         man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was the attestation in Israel.—<span class="verse-number">8</span>So the near kinsman said unto Boaz: ‘Buy it for thyself.’ And he drew off his shoe. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people: ‘Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s,
         and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi. <span class="verse-number">10</span>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I acquired to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
         inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; ye are witnesses
         this day.’ <span class="verse-number">11</span>And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said: ‘We are witnesses. The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and do thou
         worthily in Ephrath, and be famous in Beth-lehem; <span class="verse-number">12</span>and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> shall give thee of this young woman.’ 
         <span class="verse-number">13</span>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave her conception, and she bore a son. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And the women said unto Naomi: ‘Blessed be the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman, and let his name be famous in Israel. <span class="verse-number">15</span>And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee,
         who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.’ <span class="verse-number">16</span>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying: ‘There is a son born to Naomi’; and they called his name Obed; he is
         the father of Jesse, the father of David. <span class="verse-number">18</span>Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron; <span class="verse-number">19</span>and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab; <span class="verse-number">20</span>and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot
