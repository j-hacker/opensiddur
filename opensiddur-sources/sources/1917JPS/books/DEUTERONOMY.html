         <span class="small-caps">Se</span>
         <span class="small-caps"> are</span> the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel beyond the Jordan; in the wilderness, in the Arabah, over against Suph, between
         Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. <span class="verse-number">2</span>It is eleven days journey from Horeb unto Kadesh-barnea by the way of mount Seir. <span class="verse-number">3</span>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the
         children of Israel, according unto all that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had given him in commandment unto them; <span class="verse-number">4</span>after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth,
         at Edrei; <span class="verse-number">5</span>beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, took Moses upon him to expound this law, saying: <span class="verse-number">6</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: ‘Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain; <span class="verse-number">7</span>turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the
         Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the Lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore; the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon,
         as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> swore unto your fathers, to 
         Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.’ 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>And I spoke unto you at that time, saying: ‘I am not able to bear you myself alone; <span class="verse-number">10</span>the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.—<span class="verse-number">11</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as He hath promised you!—<span class="verse-number">12</span>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? <span class="verse-number">13</span>Get you, from each one of your tribes, wise men, and understanding, and full of knowledge, and I will make them heads over
         you.’ <span class="verse-number">14</span>And ye answered me, and said: ‘The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and full of knowledge, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands,
         and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, tribe by tribe. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And I charged your judges at that time, saying: ‘Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man
         and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. <span class="verse-number">17</span>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not 
         
         
         
         
         be afraid of the face of any man; for the judgment is God’s; and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me,
         and I will hear it.’ <span class="verse-number">18</span>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">19</span>And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and dreadful wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country
         of the Amorites, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. <span class="verse-number">20</span>And I said unto you: ‘Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God giveth unto us. <span class="verse-number">21</span>Behold, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God hath set the land before thee; go up, take possession, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said: ‘Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and
         bring us back word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.’ <span class="verse-number">23</span>And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe; <span class="verse-number">24</span>and they turned and went up into the mountains, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. <span class="verse-number">25</span>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us back word, and said: ‘Good
         is the land which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God giveth unto us.’ <span class="verse-number">26</span>Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; <span class="verse-number">27</span>and ye murmured in your tents, 
         and said: ‘Because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hated us, He hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
         <span class="verse-number">28</span>Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying: The people is greater and taller than we; the cities
         are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.’ <span class="verse-number">29</span>Then I said unto you: ‘Dread not, neither be afraid of them. <span class="verse-number">30</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God who goeth before you, He shall fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes; <span class="verse-number">31</span>and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place. <span class="verse-number">32</span>Yet in this thing ye do not believe the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, <span class="verse-number">33</span>Who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way
         ye should go, and in the cloud by day.’ 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">34</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying: <span class="verse-number">35</span>‘Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers,
         <span class="verse-number">36</span>save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children;
         because he hath wholly followed the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’ <span class="verse-number">37</span>Also the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in thither; <span class="verse-number">38</span>Joshua the son 
         
         
         
         
         of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither; encourage thou him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. <span class="verse-number">39</span>Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil,
         they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. <span class="verse-number">40</span>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.’ <span class="verse-number">41</span>Then ye answered and said unto me: ‘We have sinned against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, we will go up and fight, according to all that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God commanded us.’ And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and deemed it a light thing to go up into the hill-country.
         <span class="verse-number">42</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto me: ‘Say unto them: Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.’
         <span class="verse-number">43</span>So I spoke unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country. <span class="verse-number">44</span>And the Amorites, that dwell in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in
         Seir, even unto Hormah. <span class="verse-number">45</span>And ye returned and wept before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>; but the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you. <span class="verse-number">46</span>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.  Then we turned, and took our journey into the
         wilderness by the 
         way to the Red Sea, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days. 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke unto me, saying: <span class="verse-number">3</span>‘Ye have compassed this mountain long enough; turn you northward. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And command thou the people, saying: Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in
         Seir; and they will be afraid of you; take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore; <span class="verse-number">5</span>contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because
         I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession. <span class="verse-number">6</span>Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>For the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness; these forty
         years the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.’ <span class="verse-number">8</span>So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah, from Elath and from
         Ezion-geber.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto me: ‘Be not at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for
         a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.—<span class="verse-number">10</span>The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a 
         
         
         
         
         people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; <span class="verse-number">11</span>these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And in Seir dwelt the Horites aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them,
         and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave unto them.—<span class="verse-number">13</span>Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered.’ And we went over the brook Zered. <span class="verse-number">14</span>And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until
         all the generation, even the men of war, were consumed from the midst of the camp, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> swore unto them. <span class="verse-number">15</span>Moreover the hand of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was against them, to discomfit them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">16</span>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, <span class="verse-number">17</span>that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke unto me saying: <span class="verse-number">18</span>‘Thou art this day to pass over the border of Moab, even Ar; <span class="verse-number">19</span>and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, harass them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give
         thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.—<span class="verse-number">20</span>That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, <span class="verse-number">21</span>a people 
         great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead; <span class="verse-number">22</span>as He did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded
         them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day; <span class="verse-number">23</span>and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt
         in their stead.—<span class="verse-number">24</span>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of Arnon; behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king
         of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. <span class="verse-number">25</span>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who,
         when they hear the report of thee, shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.’ 
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">26</span>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying: <span class="verse-number">27</span>‘Let me pass through thy land; I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. <span class="verse-number">28</span>Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through
         on my feet; <span class="verse-number">29</span>as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan
         into the land which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God giveth us.’ 
         
         
         
         
         <span class="verse-number">30</span>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.
         
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">31</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto me: ‘Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee; begin to possess his land.’ <span class="verse-number">32</span>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz. <span class="verse-number">33</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. <span class="verse-number">34</span>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every city, the men, and the women, and the little ones; we
         left none remaining; <span class="verse-number">35</span>only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken. <span class="verse-number">36</span>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there
         was not a city too high for us: the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God delivered up all before us. <span class="verse-number">37</span>Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country,
         and wheresoever the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God forbade us.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div> 
         
         <h3>
            									Chapter 3
         </h3>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto
         battle at Edrei. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto me: ‘Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all 
         his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt
         at Heshbon.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>So the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left to
         him remaining. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region
         of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <span class="verse-number">5</span>All these were fortified cities, with high walls, gates, and bars; beside the unwalled towns a great many. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, the men, and the women,
         and the little ones. <span class="verse-number">7</span>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">8</span>And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley
         of Arnon unto mount Hermon—<span class="verse-number">9</span>which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir—<span class="verse-number">10</span>all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.—<span class="verse-number">11</span>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not
         in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit
         of a 
         
         
         
         
         man.—<span class="verse-number">12</span>And this land we took in possession at that time; from Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill-country of
         Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites; <span class="verse-number">13</span>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob—all
         that Bashan is called the land of Rephaim. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them,
         even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.—<span class="verse-number">15</span>And I gave Gilead unto Machir. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley for
         a border; even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; <span class="verse-number">17</span>the Arabah also, the Jordan being the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under
         the slopes of Pisgah eastward.  
         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">18</span>And I commanded you at that time, saying: ‘The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all
         the men of valour. <span class="verse-number">19</span>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle—I know that ye have much cattle—shall abide in your cities which I have
         given you; <span class="verse-number">20</span>until the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> 
         your God giveth them beyond the Jordan; then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying: ‘Thine eyes have seen all that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God hath done unto these two kings; so shall the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over. <span class="verse-number">22</span>Ye shall not fear them; for the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, He it is that fighteth for you.’

         by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God did for you in Egypt before thine eyes? <span class="verse-number">35</span>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightiest know 
         
         
         
         
         that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, He is God; there is none else beside Him. <span class="verse-number">36</span>Out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice, that He might instruct thee; and upon earth He made thee to see His great fire;
         and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire. <span class="verse-number">37</span>And because He loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with His presence, with His great

         Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven
         nations greater and mightier than thou; <span class="verse-number">2</span>and when the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them; thou shalt make
         no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them; <span class="verse-number">3</span>neither shalt thou make marriages with them: thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take
         unto thy son. <span class="verse-number">4</span>For he will turn away thy son from following Me, that they may serve other gods; so will the anger of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> be kindled 
         
         
         
         
         against you, and He will destroy thee quickly. <span class="verse-number">5</span>But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim,
         and burn their graven images with fire. <span class="verse-number">6</span>For thou art a holy people unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God: the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God hath chosen thee to be His own treasure, out of all peoples that are upon the face of the earth. <span class="verse-number">7</span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people—for ye were the fewest of all
         peoples—<span class="verse-number">8</span>but because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> loved you, and because He would keep the oath which He swore unto your fathers, hath the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
         <span class="verse-number">9</span>Know therefore that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God, He is God; the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments to
         a thousand generations; <span class="verse-number">10</span>and repayeth them that hate Him to their face, to destroy them; He will not be slack to him that hateth Him, He will repay
         him to his face. <span class="verse-number">11</span>Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.

            									Chapter 9
         </h3>Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself,
         cities great and fortified up to heaven, <span class="verse-number">2</span>a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom

         so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath spoken unto thee. <span class="verse-number">4</span>Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying: ‘For my righteousness the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hath brought me in to possess this land’; whereas for the wickedness of these nations the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> doth drive them out from before thee. <span class="verse-number">5</span>Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness

         <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
         <span class="verse-number">7</span>Remember, forget thou not, how thou didst make the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God wroth in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst go forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this
         place, ye have been rebellious against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Also in Horeb ye made the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> wroth, and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was angered with you to have destroyed you. <span class="verse-number">9</span>When I was gone up into the mount to 
         
         
         
         
         receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words,
         which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. <span class="verse-number">12</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto me: ‘Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have dealt
         corruptly; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>Furthermore the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke unto me, saying: ‘I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people; <span class="verse-number">14</span>let Me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier
         and greater than they.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two
         hands. <span class="verse-number">16</span>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; ye had made you a molten calf; ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded you. <span class="verse-number">17</span>And I took hold of 
         the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. <span class="verse-number">18</span>And I fell down before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye
         sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to provoke Him. <span class="verse-number">19</span>For I was in dread of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was wroth against you to destroy you. But the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hearkened unto me that time also. <span class="verse-number">20</span>Moreover the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him; and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. <span class="verse-number">21</span>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and beat it in pieces, grinding it very small, until
         it was as fine as dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.—<span class="verse-number">22</span>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye made the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> wroth. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And when the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: ‘Go up and possess the land which I have given you’; then ye rebelled against the commandment
         of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, and ye believed Him not, nor hearkened to His voice. <span class="verse-number">24</span>Ye have been rebellious against the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> from the day that I knew you.—<span class="verse-number">25</span>So I fell down before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said He would destroy you. <span class="verse-number">26</span>And I prayed unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: ‘O Lord <span class="small-caps">God</span>, destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance, 
         
         
         
         
         that Thou hast redeemed through Thy greatness, that Thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. <span class="verse-number">27</span>Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
         nor to their sin; <span class="verse-number">28</span>lest the land whence Thou broughtest us out say: Because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not able to bring them into the land which He promised unto them, and because He hated them, He hath brought them out
         to slay them in the wilderness. <span class="verse-number">29</span>Yet they are Thy people and Thine inheritance, that Thou didst bring out by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm.’

            									Chapter 10
         </h3>At that time the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto me: ‘Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto Me into the mount; and make thee an ark
         of wood. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them in
         the ark.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>So I made an ark of acacia-wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the

         of Israel journeyed from Beeroth-benejaakan to Moserah; there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered
         in the priest’s office in his stead. <span class="verse-number">7</span>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod; and from Gudgod to Jotbah, a land of brooks of water.—<span class="verse-number">8</span>At that time the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to stand before the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is his inheritance, according as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> thy God spoke unto him.—<span class="verse-number">10</span>Now I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> hearkened unto me that time also; the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> would not destroy thee. <span class="verse-number">11</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto me: ‘Arise, go before the people, causing them to set forward, that they may go in and possess the land, which

         come upon us because our God is not among us? <span class="verse-number">18</span>And I will surely hide My face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they 
         
         
         
         
         are turned unto other gods. <span class="verse-number">19</span>Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song
         may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel. <span class="verse-number">20</span>For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey; and they shall
         have eaten their fill, and waxen fat; and turned unto other gods, and served them, and despised Me, and broken My covenant;
         <span class="verse-number">21</span>then it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a

         before I have brought them into the land which I swore.’ <span class="verse-number">22</span>So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. <span class="verse-number">23</span>And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said: ‘Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of

            									Chapter 34
         </h3>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> showed him all the land, even Gilead as far as Dan; <span class="verse-number">2</span>and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the hinder sea; <span class="verse-number">3</span>and the South, and the Plain, even the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, as far as Zoar. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said unto him: ‘This is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying: I will give it unto thy
         seed; I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.’ <span class="verse-number">5</span>So Moses the servant of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And he was buried in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor; and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this
         day. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses
         were ended. <span class="verse-number">9</span>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon 
         
         
         
         
         him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Moses. <span class="verse-number">10</span>And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> knew face to face; <span class="verse-number">11</span>in all the signs and the 
         wonders, which the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land; <span class="verse-number">12</span>and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
