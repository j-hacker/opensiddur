         <chapter-number>9</chapter-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying: <verse-number>2</verse-number>‘Let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season. <verse-number>3</verse-number>In the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, ye shall keep it in its appointed season; according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.’ <verse-number>4</verse-number>And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at dusk, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. <verse-number>6</verse-number>But there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And those men said unto him: ‘We are unclean by the dead body of a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not to bring the offering of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in its appointed season among the children of Israel?’ <verse-number>8</verse-number>And Moses said unto them: ‘Stay ye, that I may hear what the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will command concerning you.’ <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>29</verse-number>And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’father-in-law: ‘We are journeying unto the place of which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said: I will give it you; come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath spoken good concerning Israel.’ <verse-number>30</verse-number>And he said unto him: ‘I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.’ <verse-number>31</verse-number>And he said: ‘Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes. <verse-number>32</verse-number>And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.’ <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>33</verse-number>And they set forward from the mount of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> three days’journey; and the ark of the covenant of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> went before them three days’journey, to seek out a resting-place for them. <verse-number>34</verse-number>And the cloud of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>35</verse-number>And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said: ‘Rise up,

         O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and let Thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee.’ <verse-number>36</verse-number>And when it rested, he said: ‘Return, O <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, unto the ten thousands of the families of Israel.’  <chapter-number>11</chapter-number>And the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in the ears of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and when the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> heard it, His anger was kindled; and the fire of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and the fire abated. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And the name of that place was called <note mark="a" id="note-221-a"> That is, <other-text font="Times New Roman,Italic" size="10.046" y="36.399">Burning</other-text>. </note>Taberah, because the fire of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> burnt among them. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the children of Israel also wept on their part, and said: ‘Would that we were given flesh to eat! <verse-number>5</verse-number>We remember the fish, which we were wont to eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; <verse-number>6</verse-number>but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all; we have nought save this manna to look to.’—<verse-number>7</verse-number>Now the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium. <verse-number>8</verse-number>The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and seethed it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of a cake baked with

         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Moses: ‘Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee. <verse-number>17</verse-number>And I will come down and speak with thee there; and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the

         <verse-number>24</verse-number>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent. <verse-number>25</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> came down in the cloud, and spoke unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders; and 
         it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. <verse-number>26</verse-number>But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were recorded, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. <verse-number>27</verse-number>And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said: ‘Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.’ <verse-number>28</verse-number>And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth up, answered and said: ‘My lord Moses, shut them in.’ <verse-number>29</verse-number>And Moses said unto him: ‘Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps> people were prophets, that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> would put His spirit upon them! ’ <verse-number>30</verse-number>And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>31</verse-number>And there went forth a wind from the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and brought across quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. <verse-number>32</verse-number>And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails; he that gathered least gathered ten heaps; and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. <verse-number>33</verse-number>While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was kindled against the

         surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against Me; in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.’ <verse-number>36</verse-number>And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who, when they returned, made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, <verse-number>37</verse-number>even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>38</verse-number>But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land. <verse-number>39</verse-number>And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel; and the people mourned greatly. <verse-number>40</verse-number>And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up to the top of the mountain, saying: ‘Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath promised; for we have sinned.’ <verse-number>41</verse-number>And Moses said: ‘Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, seeing it shall not prosper? <verse-number>42</verse-number>Go not up, for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies. <verse-number>43</verse-number>For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; forasmuch as ye are turned back from following the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will not be with you.’ <verse-number>44</verse-number>But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain; nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. <verse-number>45</verse-number>Then the Amalekite and the Canaanite, who

And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>2</verse-number>‘Speak unto 
         Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the fire-pans out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are become holy; <verse-number>3</verse-number>even the fire-pans of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar—for they are become holy, because they were offered before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>—that they may be a sign unto the children of Israel.’ <verse-number>4</verse-number>And Eleazar the priest took the brazen fire-pans, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, <verse-number>5</verse-number>to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no common man, that is not of the seed of Aaron, draw near to burn incense before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>; that he fare not as Korah, and as his company; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto him by the hand of Moses. <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>17</verse-number>‘Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers’house, of all their princes according to their fathers’houses, twelve rods; thou shalt write every man’s name upon his rod. <verse-number>18</verse-number>And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers’houses. <verse-number>19</verse-number>And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. <verse-number>20</verse-number>And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall bud; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.’ <verse-number>21</verse-number>And Moses spoke unto the children

         <verse-number>25</verse-number>and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Moses: ‘Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept there, for a token against the rebellious children; that there may be made an end of their murmurings against Me, that they die not.’ <verse-number>26</verse-number>Thus did Moses; as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded him, so did he.  <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>20</chapter-number>And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And there was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And the people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying: ‘Would that we had perished when our brethren perished before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>! <verse-number>4</verse-number>And why have ye brought the assembly of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> into this wilderness, to die there, we and our cattle? <verse-number>5</verse-number>And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.’ <verse-number>6</verse-number>And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of 
         meeting, and fell upon their faces; and the glory of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> appeared unto them. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>8</verse-number>‘Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.’ <verse-number>9</verse-number>And Moses took the rod from before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, as He commanded him. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them: ‘Hear now, ye rebels; are we to bring you forth water out of this rock?’ <verse-number>11</verse-number>And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle. <verse-number>12</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Moses and Aaron: ‘Because ye believed not in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.’ <verse-number>13</verse-number>These are the waters of <note mark="a" id="note-236-a"> That is, <other-text font="Times New Roman,Italic" size="10.046" y="36.399">Strife</other-text>. </note>Meribah, where the children of Israel strove with the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and He was sanctified in them.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>14</verse-number>And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom: ‘Thus saith thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us; <verse-number>15</verse-number>how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with

         us, and our fathers; <verse-number>16</verse-number>and when we cried unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, He heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border. <verse-number>17</verse-number>Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land; we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells; we will go along the king’s highway, we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.’ <verse-number>18</verse-number>And Edom said unto him: ‘Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.’ <verse-number>19</verse-number>And the children of Israel said unto him: ‘We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof; let me only pass through on my feet; there is no hurt.’ <verse-number>20</verse-number>And he said: ‘Thou shalt not pass through.’ And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. <verse-number>21</verse-number>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border; wherefore Israel turned away from him. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>22</verse-number>And they journeyed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor. <verse-number>23</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying: <verse-number>24</verse-number>‘Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against My word at the waters of Meribah. <verse-number>25</verse-number>Take Aaron 
         and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor. <verse-number>26</verse-number>And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.’ <verse-number>27</verse-number>And Moses did as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded; and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. <verse-number>28</verse-number>And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. <verse-number>29</verse-number>And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.  <paragraph-break/> 
         <chapter-number>21</chapter-number>And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And Israel vowed a vow unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and said: ‘If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.’ <verse-number>3</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities; and the name of the place was called <note mark="a" id="note-237-a"> That is, <other-text font="Times New Roman,Italic" size="10.046" y="36.399">Utter destruction</other-text>. </note>Hormah. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>4</verse-number>And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient because of the way. <verse-number>5</verse-number>And the people

         spoke against God, and against Moses: ‘Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.’ <verse-number>6</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And the people came to Moses, and said: ‘We have sinned, because we have spoken against the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and against thee; pray unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, that He take away the serpents from us.’ And Moses prayed for the people. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Moses: ‘Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.’ <verse-number>9</verse-number>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the pole; and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in Oboth. <verse-number>11</verse-number>And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is in front of Moab, toward the sun-rising. <verse-number>12</verse-number>From thence they journeyed, and pitched in the valley of Zered. <verse-number>13</verse-number>From thence they journeyed, and pitched on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites.—For Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites; <verse-number>14</verse-number>wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>:  <paragraph-break/>Vaheb in Suphah,

         <verse-number>15</verse-number>And the slope of the valleys  <paragraph-break/>That inclineth toward the seat of Ar,  <paragraph-break/>And leaneth upon the border of Moab.— <paragraph-break/>

         Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. <verse-number>24</verse-number>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. <verse-number>25</verse-number>And Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof. <verse-number>26</verse-number>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon. <verse-number>27</verse-number>Wherefore they that speak in parables say:  <paragraph-break/>Come ye to Heshbon!  <paragraph-break/>Let the city of Sihon be built and established! <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>For a fire is gone out of Heshbon,  <paragraph-break/>A flame from the city of Sihon;  <paragraph-break/>It hath devoured Ar of Moab,  <paragraph-break/>The lords of the high places of Arnon. <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>29</verse-number>Woe to thee, Moab!  <paragraph-break/>Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh;  <paragraph-break/>He hath given his sons as fugitives,  <paragraph-break/>And his daughters into captivity,  <paragraph-break/>Unto Sihon king of the Amorites. <paragraph-break/>

         there. <verse-number>33</verse-number>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. <verse-number>34</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Moses: ‘Fear him not; for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.’ <verse-number>35</verse-number>So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him remaining; and they possessed his land.  <chapter-number>22</chapter-number>And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. <parashah-title>בלק</parashah-title>

         <verse-number>2</verse-number>And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was overcome with dread because of the children of Israel. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And Moab said unto the elders of Midian: ‘Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.’—And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.—<verse-number>5</verse-number>And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying: ‘Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me. <verse-number>6</verse-number>Come now therefore, I pray thee,

         curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me; peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.’ <verse-number>7</verse-number>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spoke unto him the words of Balak. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And he said unto them: ‘Lodge here this night, and I will bring you back word, as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> may speak unto me’; and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. <verse-number>9</verse-number>And God came unto Balaam, and said: ‘What men are these with thee?’ <verse-number>10</verse-number>And Balaam said unto God: ‘Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me [saying]: <verse-number>11</verse-number>Behold the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth; now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’ <verse-number>12</verse-number>And God said unto Balaam: ‘Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.’ <verse-number>13</verse-number>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak: ‘Get you into your land; for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> refuseth to give me leave to go with you.’ <verse-number>14</verse-number>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said: ‘Balaam refuseth to come with us.’ <verse-number>15</verse-number>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. <verse-number>16</verse-number>And they came to Balaam, and said to him: ‘Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor: Let 
         nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me; <verse-number>17</verse-number>for I will promote thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.’ <verse-number>18</verse-number>And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak: ‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> my God, to do any thing, small or great. <verse-number>19</verse-number>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will speak unto me more.’ <verse-number>20</verse-number>And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him: ‘If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.’ <verse-number>21</verse-number>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. <verse-number>22</verse-number>And God’s anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> placed himself in the way for an adversary against him.—Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.—<verse-number>23</verse-number>And the ass saw the angel of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. <verse-number>24</verse-number>Then the angel of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> stood in a hollow way between the vineyards, a fence being on this side, and a fence on that side. <verse-number>25</verse-number>And the ass saw the angel of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot

         I will get me back.’ <verse-number>35</verse-number>And the angel of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Balaam: ‘Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.’ So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. <verse-number>36</verse-number>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto Ir-moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. <verse-number>37</verse-number>And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?’ <verse-number>38</verse-number>And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power at all to speak any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.’ <verse-number>39</verse-number>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth. <verse-number>40</verse-number>And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. <verse-number>41</verse-number>And it came to pass in the morning that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into Bamoth-baal, and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.  <chapter-number>23</chapter-number>And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.’ <verse-number>2</verse-number>And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; peradventure the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will come to meet me; and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell

         <verse-number>8</verse-number>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?  <paragraph-break/>And how shall I execrate, whom the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath not execrated? <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>9</verse-number>For from the top of the rocks I see him,  <paragraph-break/>And from the hills I behold him:  <paragraph-break/>Lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone,  <paragraph-break/>And shall not be reckoned among the nations.  <paragraph-break/>

I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.’ <verse-number>12</verse-number>And he answered and said: ‘Must I not take 
         heed to speak that which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> putteth in my mouth?’ <verse-number>13</verse-number>And Balak said unto him: ‘Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from thence.’ <verse-number>14</verse-number>And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And he said unto Balak: ‘Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I go toward a meeting yonder.’ <verse-number>16</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said: ‘Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.’ <verse-number>17</verse-number>And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him: ‘What hath the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoken?’ <verse-number>18</verse-number>And he took up his parable, and said:  <paragraph-break/>Arise, Balak, and hear;  <paragraph-break/>Give ear unto me, thou son of Zippor:  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>19</verse-number>God is not a man, that He should lie;  <paragraph-break/>Neither the son of man, that He should repent:  <paragraph-break/>When He hath said, will He not do it?  <paragraph-break/>Or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good?  <paragraph-break/>

         <verse-number>24</verse-number>Behold a people that riseth up as a lioness,  <paragraph-break/>And as a lion doth he lift himself up;  <paragraph-break/>He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,  <paragraph-break/>And drink the blood of the slain. <verse-number>25</verse-number>And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.’ <verse-number>26</verse-number>But Balaam answered and said unto Balak: ‘Told not I thee, saying: All that the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> speaketh, that I must do?’ <verse-number>27</verse-number>And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.’ <verse-number>28</verse-number>And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert. <verse-number>29</verse-number>And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.’ <verse-number>30</verse-number>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.  
         <chapter-number>24</chapter-number>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe; and the spirit of God came upon him. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And he took up his parable, and said:  <paragraph-break/>The saying of Balaam the son of Beor,  <paragraph-break/>And the saying of the man whose eye is opened; <paragraph-break/>

         <chapter-number>25</chapter-number>And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab. <verse-number>2</verse-number>And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And Israel joined himself unto the Baal of Peor; and the anger of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> was kindled against Israel. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> said unto Moses: ‘Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in face of the sun, that the fierce anger of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> may turn away from Israel.’ <verse-number>5</verse-number>And Moses said unto the judges of Israel: ‘Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto the Baal of Peor.’ <verse-number>6</verse-number>And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting. <verse-number>7</verse-number>And 
         when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And he went after the man of Israel into the chamber, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly.

         <verse-number>2</verse-number>And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying:  <paragraph-break/>This is the thing which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded. <verse-number>3</verse-number>When a man voweth a vow unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. <verse-number>4</verse-number>Also when a woman voweth a vow unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father’s house, in her youth, <verse-number>5</verse-number>and her father heareth her vow, or her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. <verse-number>6</verse-number>But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand; and the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> will forgive her, because her father

         <verse-number>13</verse-number>And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. <verse-number>15</verse-number>And Moses said unto them: ‘Have ye saved all the women alive? <verse-number>16</verse-number>Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to revolt so as to break faith with the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>17</verse-number>Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. <verse-number>18</verse-number>But all the women children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. <verse-number>19</verse-number>And encamp ye without the camp seven days; whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the 
         third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives. <verse-number>20</verse-number>And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’hair, and all things made of wood, ye shall purify.’ <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>21</verse-number>And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle: ‘This is the statute of the law which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded Moses: <verse-number>22</verse-number>Howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, <verse-number>23</verse-number>every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of sprinkling; and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water. <verse-number>24</verse-number>And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye may come into the camp.’ <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>25</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> spoke unto Moses, saying: <verse-number>26</verse-number>‘Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’houses of the congregation; <verse-number>27</verse-number>and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation; <verse-number>28</verse-number>and levy a tribute unto the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the flocks; <verse-number>29</verse-number>take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, as a portion set apart for the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>30</verse-number>And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of

         <chapter-number>32</chapter-number>Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle; and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle, <verse-number>2</verse-number>the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying: <verse-number>3</verse-number>‘Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon, <verse-number>4</verse-number>the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.’ <verse-number>5</verse-number>And they said: ‘If we have found favour in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over the Jordan.’ <verse-number>6</verse-number>And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben: ‘Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here? <verse-number>7</verse-number>And wherefore will ye turn away the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath given them? <verse-number>8</verse-number>Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land. <verse-number>9</verse-number>For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they turned away the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> had given them. <verse-number>10</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps> anger was kindled in that day, and He swore, saying: <verse-number>11</verse-number>Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see 
         the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed Me; <verse-number>12</verse-number>save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>. <verse-number>13</verse-number>And the <small-caps>Lord’s</small-caps> anger was kindled against Israel, and He made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, was consumed. <verse-number>14</verse-number>And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’stead, a brood of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> toward Israel. <verse-number>15</verse-number>For if ye turn away from after Him, He will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and so ye will destroy all this people.’  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>16</verse-number>And they came near unto him, and said: ‘We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones; <verse-number>17</verse-number>but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place; and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. <verse-number>18</verse-number>We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. <verse-number>19</verse-number>For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward, because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.’ <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>20</verse-number>And Moses said unto them: ‘If ye will do this thing: if ye will arm yourselves to go before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> to the

         <verse-number>25</verse-number>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke unto Moses, saying: ‘Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. <verse-number>26</verse-number>Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead; <verse-number>27</verse-number>but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> to battle, as my lord saith.’ <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>28</verse-number>So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’houses of the tribes of the children of Israel. <verse-number>29</verse-number>And Moses said unto them: ‘If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, and the land shall be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession; <verse-number>30</verse-number>but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions

         <chapter-number>36</chapter-number>And the heads of the fathers’houses of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’houses of the children of Israel; <verse-number>2</verse-number>and they said: ‘The <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel; and my lord was commanded by the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. <verse-number>3</verse-number>And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong; so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. <verse-number>4</verse-number>And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong; so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.’ <verse-number>5</verse-number>And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps>, saying: ‘The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right. <verse-number>6</verse-number>This is the 
         thing which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying: Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. <verse-number>7</verse-number>So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. <verse-number>8</verse-number>And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. <verse-number>9</verse-number>So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.’ <verse-number>10</verse-number>Even as the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. <verse-number>11</verse-number>For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’sons. <verse-number>12</verse-number>They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.  <paragraph-break/>
         <verse-number>13</verse-number>These are the commandments and the ordinances, which the <small-caps>Lord</small-caps> commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
