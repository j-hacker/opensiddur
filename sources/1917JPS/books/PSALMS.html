               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">2</span>I will open my mouth with a parable;

               <span class="verse-number">3</span>That which we have heard and known,

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">5</span>For He established a testimony in Jacob,

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">9</span>The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow,

               <span class="verse-number">11</span>And they forgot His doings,

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">12</span>Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers,

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">13</span>He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through;  
               
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And He made the waters to stand as a heap. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">14</span>By day also He led them with a cloud,

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">15</span>He cleaved rocks in the wilderness,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">16</span>He brought streams also out of the rock,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And caused waters to run down like rivers. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">17</span>Yet went they on still to sin against Him,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>To rebel against the Most High in the desert. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">18</span>And they tried God in their heart  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>By asking food for their craving. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">19</span>Yea, they spoke against God;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>They said 'Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">20</span>Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And streams overflowed;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Can He give bread also?  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Or will He provide flesh for His people?' 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">21</span>Therefore the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> heard, and was wroth;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And a fire was kindled against Jacob,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And anger also went up against Israel; 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">22</span>Because they believed not in God,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And trusted not in His salvation. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">23</span>And He commanded the skies above,  
               
               
               
               
               
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And opened the doors of heaven; 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">24</span>And He caused manna to rain upon them for food,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And gave them of the corn of heaven. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">25</span>Man did eat the bread of the mighty;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>He sent them provisions to the full. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">26</span>He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And by His power He brought on the south wind. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">27</span>He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And winged fowl as the sand of the seas; 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">28</span>And He let it fall in the midst of their camp,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Round about their dwellings. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">29</span>So they did eat, and were well filled;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And He gave them that which they craved. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">30</span>They were not estranged from their craving,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Their food was yet in their mouths, 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">31</span>When the anger of God went up against them,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And slew of the lustieth among them,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And smote down the young men of Israel. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">32</span>For all this they sinned still,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And believed not in His wondrous works. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">33</span>Therefore He ended their days as a breath,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And their years in terror. 
               
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">34</span>When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And turn back and seek God earnestly. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">35</span>And they remembered that God was their Rock,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And the Most High God their redeemer. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">36</span>But they beguiled Him with their mouth,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And lied unto Him with their tongue. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">37</span>For their heart was not stedfast with Him,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Neither were they faithful in His covenant. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">38</span>But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And doth not stir up all His wrath. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">39</span>So He remembered that they were but flesh,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">40</span>How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And grieve Him in the desert! 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">41</span>And still again they tried God,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And set bounds to the Holy One of Israel. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">42</span>They remembered not His hand,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">43</span>How He set His signs in Egypt,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And His wonders in the field of Zoan; 
               
               
               
               
               
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">44</span>And turned their rivers into blood,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>So that they could not drink their streams. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">45</span>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And frogs, which destroyed them. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">46</span>He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And their labour unto the locust. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">47</span>He destroyed their vines with hail,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And their sycamore-trees with frost. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">48</span>He gave over their cattle also to the hail,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And their flocks to fiery bolts. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">49</span>He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>Wrath, and indignation, and trouble,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>A sending of messengers of evil. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">50</span>He levelled a path for His anger;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>He spared not their soul from death,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>But gave their life over to the pestilence; 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">51</span>And smote all the first-born in Egypt,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham; 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">52</span>But He made His own people to go forth like sheep,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">53</span>And He led them safely, and they feared not;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">54</span>And He brought them to His holy border,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>To the mountain, which His right hand had gotten. 
               
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">55</span>He drove out the nations also before them,

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">56</span>Yet they tried and provoked God, the Most High,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And kept not His testimonies; 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">57</span>But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers;  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">58</span>For they provoked Him with their high places,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And moved Him to jealousy with their graven images. 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">59</span>God heard, and was wroth,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>And He greatly abhorred Israel; 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">60</span>And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>The tent which He had made to dwell among men; 
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">61</span>And delivered His strength into captivity,

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">62</span>He gave His people over also unto the sword;

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">63</span>Fire devoured their young men;

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">64</span>Their priests fell by the sword;

               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
