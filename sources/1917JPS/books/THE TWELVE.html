               So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. <span class="verse-number">8</span>Then said they unto him: ‘Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is thine occupation? and whence
               comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?’ <span class="verse-number">9</span>And he said unto them: ‘I am an Hebrew; and I fear the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him: ‘What is this that thou hast done?’ For the men knew that he fled
               from the presence of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, because he had told them.  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">11</span>Then said they unto him: ‘What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us?’ for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
               <span class="verse-number">12</span>And he said unto them: ‘Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for
               my sake this great tempest is upon you.’ <span class="verse-number">13</span>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against
               them. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Wherefore they cried unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: ‘We beseech Thee, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, we beseech Thee, let us not perish for 
               this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for Thou, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, hast done as it pleased Thee.’ <span class="verse-number">15</span>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging. <span class="verse-number">16</span>Then the men feared the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and made vows.

               </h3>And the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> came unto Jonah the second time, saying: <span class="verse-number">2</span>‘Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and make unto it the proclamation that I bid thee.’ <span class="verse-number">3</span>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’journey. <span class="verse-number">4</span>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he proclaimed, and said: ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
               overthrown.’  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">5</span>And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to
               the least of them. <span class="verse-number">6</span>And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with
               sackcloth, and sat in 
               ashes. <span class="verse-number">7</span>And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: ‘Let neither
               man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water; <span class="verse-number">8</span>but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one
               from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. <span class="verse-number">9</span>Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?’  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">10</span>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which He said He would do unto

                  									Chapter 4
               </h3>did it not. <span class="verse-number">1</span>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. <span class="verse-number">2</span>And he prayed unto the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: ‘I pray Thee, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, was not this my saying, when I was yet in mine own country? Therefore I fled beforehand unto Tarshish; for I knew that Thou
               art a gracious God, and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, and repentest Thee of the evil. <span class="verse-number">3</span>Therefore now, O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, take, I beseech Thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.’ <span class="verse-number">4</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: ‘Art thou greatly angry?’  
               <div class="paragraph-break">¶</div>
               <span class="verse-number">5</span>Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the

               <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his
               evil. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd. <span class="verse-number">7</span>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered. <span class="verse-number">8</span>And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
               that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said: ‘It is better for me to die than to live.’ 
               <span class="verse-number">9</span>And God said to Jonah: ‘Art thou greatly angry for the gourd?’ And he said: ‘I am greatly angry, even unto death.’ <span class="verse-number">10</span>And the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said: ‘Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night,
               and perished in a night; <span class="verse-number">11</span>and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern
               between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?’

               silver, and cast them into the treasury, in the house of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span class="verse-number">14</span>Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Binders, that the brotherhood between Judah and Israel might be broken.
